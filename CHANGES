    have_macros have_mailer have_zones have_plushelp ident_timeout
    mail_database mail_expiration number_guests parent_recursion_limit
    plushelp_file plushelp_index wiznews_file wiznews_index
    zone_recursion_limit
- New search classes:
    POWER ZONE
- @list powers added.
- @decompile now shows zones, and parents.
- ANSI color support has been introduced. Names of things, rooms, and exits
  may include ANSI color, and in most cases name checks will be matched as
  if the name did not have color.
- In addition to the ansi() function, the %c substitution may be used for
  ANSI color. ANSI_NORMAL will be appended to any string that contains ANSI.
- A channel system/comsystem has been added.

    @cboot @ccharge @ccheck @cchown @ccreate @cdestroy @cdiscover @cemit
    @clist @coflags @cpflags @csec @cset @csweep @cundiscover @cusersec
    @cwho addcom allcom comlist comtitle clearcom delcom tapcom
- A new mail system has been introduced.
- Mailer commands:
    @mail @malias
- Mailer manages a linked list for each player, hashed table of player
  dbrefs in use.
- Reviewing and retraction of mail sent to players added.

- Macro commands:
    .add .chmod .create .CLEAR .def .del .desc .edit .ex .gex .list .undef
    .status 
- Support for multiple guests characters added, similar to old system, 
  Guests are locked, set ANSI and NO_COMMAND, and inherit the zone,
  parent, money, @desc, @aconnect and @disconnect of the prototype guest
  character.
- Zones have been implemented. Control of a zone object gives a player
  control of all objects zoned to that object. Commands set on a zone object
  will be inherited by all objects in that zone. @aconnects and @disconnects
  are also inherited. @chzone is the command to change zones.
- @aconnects and @adisconnects set on the master room are global.
- Powers have been introduced, granting certain aspects of wizard power to
  individual characters using @power.

      page [<player-list>] = <message>
  The last paged player or list of players can be paged with just
      page <message>
- Wizards may now 'cd' at the login screen to connect DARK.
- Two new indexed files, for +help and wiznews. The file for +help may
  include percent substitutions for color.
- BUILDER is no longer a flag, converted to a power.
- Wizards no longer obey any kind of lock.
- RWHO code has been removed.
- iter(), parse(), and @dolist now use #@ as a marker to show the position
  within the list.
- @edit now hilites the changed text.
- Log now shows exact failed connect string.
- #1 can no longer @newpassword itself.
- Updated to read flat file databases up to PennMUSH 1.50 p13, will also
  read DarkZone variant of PennMUSH database.

- OUTPUT_BLOCK_SIZE defined in config.h, tune for your memory needs.
- The commands SESSION, DOING, WHO, QUIT, LOGOUT, OUTPUTPREFIX, and
  OUTPUTSUFFIX are no longer case sensitive after login.
- The flags wizard, and hidden may now be @set on attributes.

  certain number of days. 
- Minor bug in setinter() fixed, ex: setinter(a a a b b b, a a b b) 

Internal code changes:
- New functions nhash_firstentry and nhash_nextentry for numbered hashtables.
- search_nametab now returns -2 if permission is not given.
- Logged out commands no longer checked when player is connected, and have
  been included in regular command table. SESSION, DOING, WHO, QUIT, LOGOUT,
  OUTPUTPREFIX, and OUTPUTSUFFIX, when connected, affect all of the player's
  logged in descriptors.
- Username and hostname lookups now done by a slave process, to prevent lag
  when a nameserver or ident server is locked up. Ident processing is done
  much more reliably, with a 5 minute timeout.
- functions.c split into functions.c and funceval.c. Most new functions are
  in funceval.c.
- The GNU database manager is required for use.

- When a switch is used, the permission for that command will no longer be
  checked before the permission for the switch.

  objects when the database is loaded.
- A bug which permits overflow of certain buffers from the connect screen
  has been fixed.

  decode_flags and flag_describe.
- @alias now checks to see if the alias is a valid player name.
- 'Three message' bug in @destroy, when two objects of the same name are
  nearby, is fixed.

  executes them.

  via options in the Makefile.

  (Andrew Molitor)
- @mail/fwd now allows you to edit a message before sending.

- Channel usage now costs a set amount of money, specifiable by the channel
  owner or a wizard.

  way rooms were destroyed in earlier patchlevels.

Internal code changes:

- Hashing is smart: often used keys are looked up faster.

TinyMUX 1.1 patchlevel 0:

  VACATION - set only by wizards, reset when player connects. Helps mark
  inactive players who will eventually return.

  (to be enabled in patchlevel 1)
- Concentrator integrated and made part of MUX distribution.
  (to be enabled in patchlevel 1)
- Fixed bug in @mail/quick.
- Fixed bug with names and pennies of cloned objects disappearing.
- Parser changed for speed, and all functions modified to support the new
  parser changes. (idea by T. Alexander Popiel)
- Guests are no longer set ANSI and NO_COMMAND by default, they follow
  the player_flags parameter.
- Names in page and mail lists are now seperated by commas.
- When given a dbref number, pmatch() will evaluate identically to num().
- Fixed bad names bug which allowed multiple players of the same name.

  was changed. Buffer lengths may be freely changed.
- Buffer lengths doubled.
- WHO now shows the record number of players connected since startup, and
  the maximum number of players allowed online.
- @mail bugs that caused random seg faults fixed.
- Fixed crash bug with push() used with no arguments.
- If an object or it's owner is set DESTROY_OK, it is destroyed with no
  delay when @destroy'ed.
- Added a 3rd flag word.
- Problems loading some Penn 1.50.p15 databases fixed.
- @list process now shows number of descriptors available to the process.
- pemit() args are now only evaluated once.

TinyMUX 1.1 patchlevel 1:

- New functions:
  setr
- New switches:
  @function/preserve: Preserves registers across user defined functions.
- New exec() option: EV_NO_LOCATION, surpresses use of %l in an expression.
- The enactor for Idle, Away, and Reject messages is now the paging player.
  Messages are not sent if they evaluate to nothing. %l surpressed.
- 'GARGAGE' type added to search classes.
- Problem with @daily attributes fixed.
- pemit() and @pemit/list check for permission.
- @decompile now works with obj/attr, and takes wildcards for the attr.
- Database strings are now encapsulated using quotation marks, ala PennMUSH.
- queue_write now uses MBUFs to store output, instead of malloc.
- Record number of players is now stored permanently in the database, using
  tag of '-R<number>'.
- @malias/add and @malias/remove may now take dbrefs as arguments.
- MBUF_SIZE reduced to 200 bytes.
- Dark players leaving/joining a channel do not emit messages on the
  channel.
- Fixed problem with name() on exits without aliases.
- @restart now works consistently along with database checkpointing, and is
  more reliable.
- Database consistency checking introduced, using checksums. Checks are made
  on strings in memory, as well as disk-based strings. When corruption is
  found, <gamename>.db.CORRUPT is dumped and the process exits. This is
  designed to detect unknown modification of strings in memory and on disk.
  Note that it will not fix corruption, only keep it from going unnoticed.
  Regular backups are the only way to ensure data integrity.
- A termination signal will cause the MUX to dump to the flatfile
  <gamename>.db.KILLED instead of dumping normally.
- The 'Startmux' script will refuse to start if either <gamename>.db.KILLED
  or <gamename>.db.CORRUPT are present, in case they are unnoticed.
