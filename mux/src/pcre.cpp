/* PCRE keeps offsets in its compiled code as 2-byte quantities by default.
These are used, for example, to link from the start of a subpattern to its
alternatives and its end. The use of 2 bytes per offset limits the size of the
compiled regex to around 64K, which is big enough for almost everybody.
However, I received a request for an even bigger limit. For this reason, and
also to make the code easier to maintain, the storing and loading of offsets
from the byte string is now handled by the macros that are defined here.

The macros are controlled by the value of LINK_SIZE. This defaults to 2 in
the config.h file, but can be overridden by using -D on the command line. This
is automated on Unix systems via the "configure" command. */

all of whose alternatives start with OP_SOD or OP_CIRC (recurse ad lib), then
it's anchored. However, if this is a multiline pattern, then only OP_SOD
counts, since OP_CIRC can match in the middle.

We can also consider a regex to be anchored if OP_SOM starts all its branches.
This is the code for \G, which means "match at start of match position, taking
into account the match offset".

A branch is also implicitly anchored if it starts with .* and DOTALL is set,
because that will try the rest of the pattern at all possible matching points,
so there is no point trying again.... er ....

.... except when the .* appears inside capturing parentheses, and there is a
subsequent back reference to those parentheses. We haven't enough information
to catch that case precisely.

At first, the best we could do was to detect when .* was in capturing brackets
and the highest back reference was greater than or equal to that level.
However, by keeping a bitmap of the first 31 back references, we can catch some
of the more common cases more precisely.

                   RECURSION IN THE match() FUNCTION

The match() function is highly recursive. Some regular expressions can cause
it to recurse thousands of times. I was writing for Unix, so I just let it
call itself recursively. This uses the stack for saving everything that has
to be saved for a recursive call. On Unix, the stack can be large, and this
works fine.

It turns out that on non-Unix systems there are problems with programs that
use a lot of stack. (This despite the fact that every last chip has oodles
of memory these days, and techniques for extending the stack have been known
for decades.) So....

There is a fudge, triggered by defining NO_RECURSE, which avoids recursive
calls by keeping local variables that need to be preserved in blocks of memory
obtained from malloc instead instead of on the stack. Macros are used to
achieve this so that the actual code doesn't look very different to what it
always used to.

last bracketed group - used for breaking infinite loops matching zero-length
strings. This function is called recursively in many circumstances. Whenever it
returns a negative (error) response, the outer incarnation must also return the
same response.

Performance note: It might be tempting to extract commonly used fields from the
md structure (e.g. utf8, end_subject) into individual variables to improve
performance. Tests using gcc on a SPARC disproved this; in the first case, it
made performance worse.

Arguments:

   offset_top  current top pointer
   md          pointer to "static" info for the match

   eptrb       pointer to chain of blocks containing eptr at start of

                 match_condassert - this is an assertion condition
