/*********** THIS IS AN ALTERED VERSION! ****************/
/*
   This is an altered version of pcre. It has been altered by
   Alan Schwartz ("Javelin") and Shawn Wagner ("Raevnos") for
   inclusion in PennMUSH.
   Some changes include:
    * All pcre code combined into pcre.c/pcre.h pair
    * includes of config/confmagic.h
    * pcre_malloc and pcre_free changed to malloc and free
    * Deleted some never-used functions (pcre_version, pcre_info, etc.)
    * Tries to avoid infinitely-long backtracking (Raevnos)
    * Remove unused UTF-8 support.
    * Converted to C++ for MUX.

/* This function applies a compiled re to a subject string and picks out
portions of the string if it matches. Two elements in the vector are set for
each substring: the offsets to the start and end of the substring.

Arguments:
  external_re     points to the compiled expression
  external_extra  points to "hints" from pcre_study() or is NULL
  subject         points to the subject string
  length          length of subject string (may contain binary zeros)
  start_offset    where to start in the subject string
  options         option bits
  offsets         points to a vector of ints to be filled in with offsets
  offsetcount     the number of elements in the vector

Returns:          > 0 => success; value is the number of elements filled in
                  = 0 => success, but offsets is not big enough
                   -1 => failed to match
                 < -1 => some kind of unexpected problem

/*************************************************
*      Copy captured string to given buffer      *
*************************************************/

/* This function copies a single captured substring into a given buffer.
Note that we use memcpy() rather than strncpy() in case there are binary zeros
in the string.

Arguments:
  subject        the subject string that was matched
  ovector        pointer to the offsets table
  stringcount    the number of substrings that were captured
                   (i.e. the yield of the pcre_exec call, unless
                   that was zero, in which case it should be 1/3
                   of the offset table size)
  stringnumber   the number of the required substring
  buffer         where to put the substring
  size           the size of the buffer

Returns:         if successful:
                   the length of the copied string, not including the zero
                   that is put on the end; can be zero
                 if not successful:
                   PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY (-6) buffer too small
                   PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING (-7) no such captured substring
