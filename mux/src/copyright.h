 * TinyMUX 2.12 Copyright: The Artistic License
 *
 * Preamble
 *
 * The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 * Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 * semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 * while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 * the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
 * make reasonable modifications.
 *
 * Definitions:
 *     - "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
 *       Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
 *       created through textual modification.
 *     - "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
 *       modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of
 *       the Copyright Holder.
 *     - "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
 *       copyrights for the package.
 *     - "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
 *       this Package.
 *     - "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis
 *       of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and
 *       so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
 *       Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market
 *       that must bear the fee.)
 *     - "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
 *       itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It
 *       also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under
 *       the same conditions they received it.
 *
 * 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
 * the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
 * that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
 * associated disclaimers.
 *
 * 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 * derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
 * modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 *
 * 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
 * provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
 * stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
 * at least ONE of the following:
 *
 *   a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
 *   them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
 *   Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a
 *   major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
 *   Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
 *   Package.
 *
 *   b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
 *   organization.
 *
 *   c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
 *   with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
 *   a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that
 *   clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 *   d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 *
 * 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 * executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 *
 *   a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
 *   files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
 *   equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
 *
 *   b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
 *   the Package with your modifications.
 *
 *   c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
 *   Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
 *   non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in
 *   manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where
 *   to get the Standard Version.
 *
 *   d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 *
 * 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
 * this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
 * Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
 * you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
 * commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
 * software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
 * as a product of your own.
 *
 * 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 * output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
 * under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
 * them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
 * Package.
 *
 * 7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
 * shall not be considered part of this Package.
 *
 * 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
 * promote products derived from this software without specific prior
 * written permission.
 *
 * 9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 * WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
