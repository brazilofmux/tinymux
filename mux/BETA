TinyMUX 2.10: BETA
Last Update: May 2011

Welcome
~~~~~~~

The usual care and effort has been invested to ensure the quality of this
year's Beta.  Also, at least three games have been running it for five months.
One of these games is quite large.  This year's main feature is color --
specifically xterm-style, 256-color as well as MXP/HTML-style, 24-bit color.

This BETA contains at least one crash-bug.  We have not been able as of yet,
to find or reproduce it.

Be careful, and leave yourself a way out.  Due to the addition of rich color,
the only path for down-converting a 2.10 database to 2.9 is the use of the
Omega flatfile utility.  TinyMUX 2.9 is not able to consume a 2.10 database.


General Cautions During the Beta Period:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please take the time to read the README.  These files should be
helpful to you.  If they are not helpful, then please help us improve
the documentation by suggesting specific changes.  Documentation bugs
can usually be fixed more rapidly than any other type of bug.


Whether you start a new game or port an existing one to this BETA:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Make frequent backups.  We cannot stress this enough.  The included
      Backup script is your friend and should make this process effortless.

    - Make complete backups of all of your config, text, mail, and
      comsystems.

    - Store your backups off site.  This was always prudent anyway.

    - Run your game as usual.

    - Report Bugs to brazilofmux@gmail.com following the procedure in README.
