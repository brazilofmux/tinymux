TinyMUX 2.6: NOTES
Last Update: January 2006

This is a list of information that never seems to be handy enough when you
need it.

Handy Stuff:
~~~~~~~~~~~
 - The default password for Wizard(#1) is 'potrzebie'.

 - For new games, change the password for #1 first thing and *write it down*
   in a safe place offline.

 - It is worth noting that keeping a record of changes in the #1 character
   password might save you some flatfile hacking for forgotten passwords.

 - The default port has been changed to 2860.  Change this in the
   netmux.conf or GAMENAME.conf file.

 - Always be sure to ftp files in 'binary' mode.  Otherwise, you can expect
   your data to be unusable.

 - Default GAMENAME will be netmux. If you changed the GAMENAME in
   mux.config, be sure to change the filenames in GAMENAME.conf as well,
   otherwise, the TinyMUX won't be able to find your DB.

 - Read 'wizhelp config parameters' when you get the TinyMUX started. If you
   are porting from PennMUSH, for example, where the master room is set
   as #2, you would have to place the config parameter 'master_room 2' in
   your configuration file.

 - Database numbers in GAMENAME.conf should NEVER have '#' in front of
   them, only the number itself is necessary.  '#' actually comments out
   what follows it and makes it invisible to the game.

 - If you had a mail database previously, remember to adjust
   mail_expiration accordingly, or else ALL @mail older than the default
   value of 14 days will be deleted.

 - 'Backup' has superceeded the traditional use of db_unload for making
   flatfiles.  The script makes a flatfile of the DB and also creates a
   tar.gz file containing the mail,db, comsys.db, configuration files,
   and the customized files in game/text.  When porting, all you have to do
   is place the backup in the game directory, extract the archive and db_load
   before restarting the game.

Changes to dbconvert:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - dbconvert is the means by which the binary game data is converted to
   flatfile format and back again.  The db_load and db_unload scripts
   simplify the process for the user.

 - The syntax of the scripts is:

   - './db_load netmux netmux.flat netmux.db'

     This converts flatfiled database to binary for use by the server and
     would be done with dbconvert thus:

     ../bin/dbconvert -dnetmux -inetmux.flat -onetmux.db -l

   - './db_unload netmux netmux.db.new netmux.flat'

     This converts binary data to flatfile for would be done with dbconvert
     thus:

     ../bin/dbconvert -dnetmux -inetmux.db.new -onetmux.flat -u


On Flatfiles:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - You MUST unload to flatfile if you are using a disk-based database when
   you move to a new machine, no matter what platform; only the flatfile is
   portable!

 - When you unload the database to flatfile format it is important to
   use your original db_unload/dbconvert.  *We cannot stress this enough.*
   Data loss is possible, especially since db_unload/dbconvert sometimes
   changes between releases.

 - Flatfiles are the most stable format to store and move your data in.
   Yes, the occasional miracle happens to let someone bring a game back
   up from binary data moved from the nether regions of the net.  However,
   this isn't the place for beginners or the faint of heart.  As always,
   store backups in a remote location.

On Making Backups:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - TinyMUX 2.6 includes a backup script.  It produces a flatfile with the
   name GAMENAME.DATE.tar.gz that contains both the mail.db and comsys.db
   which will appear in the game directory. To make use of the Backup
   script:

     - @shutdown the game.

     - cd to the game directory.

     - Type './Backup'

     - Restart the game using ./Startmux

     - Move the backup to onsite and offsite storage locations.

On Tools:
~~~~~~~~
 - announce.c sits and listens on a specified port.  Whenever anyone
   connects, it announces a message and disconnects them.

 - You should create a message and call the file 'message_file'.  This will
   serve as your announcement to people trying to connect.

 - Compile announce.c by typing 'gcc -o announce announce.c'.  If you are
   not using the GNU compiler, substitute the C compiler in use on your
   system.

 - Type 'announce port < message_file' and the port announcer will take
   over from there.
