TinyMUX 2.12: MODULES
Last Update: July 2012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modules are a separate package of hardcode that provide and use well-defined
interfaces within the main server to accomplish their purpose.  Modules
provided by third parties will necessarily be documented by those third
parties.  Also, this read-me file is not sufficient for adapting the
provided samples into your own modules.  Since modules are a Poor Man's
adaptation of COM, the best documentation for modules at the current time is a
combination of the sample sources, the TinyMUX wiki, and various books
written about COM and OLE.

As long as your platform is Windows or supports dlopen(), modules are enabled
by default.  However, to support loading of modules in a separate slave process,
it is necessary to add --enable-stubslave at the ./configure step described in
INSTALL.

Under the src/modules directory, you will find the modules provided with
TinyMUX.  These include two sample modules that are primiarly useful as a
starting point for you or others to write their own modules.  Also included
are two modules required for Asyncronous SQL support.  To build these, you
need to build TinyMUX in src first.  That has the side-effect of running
./configure in src/modules for you, but you can do it again from src/modules
if you like.  Then, do the following from the src/modules directory:

  1. make

To load the sample and sum modules, add the following to netmux.conf:

module sample
module sum slave

When you start TinyMUX, these modules are loaded and will log additional
messages in the server log to demonstrate that they are working.  The sum
module adds two numbers together in a separate process.  The sample module
opens the logging interfaces and the server events interface to capture and
log server events as they occur.
