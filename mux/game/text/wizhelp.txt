& HELP

  This is the MUX online help facility for wizard commands and topics.
  The information provided by this command is generally not useful for
  anyone other than wizards and game maintainers, as the features described
  here are only accessible to characters whose WIZARD bit is set, or to those
  who have access to the directory where the MUX data files reside.

  Syntax of help command:
     wizhelp [<command/topic>]

& @ADDCOMMAND
@ADDCOMMAND

  COMMAND: @addcommand <name>=<thing>/<attribute>

  This command has the capability of adding a softcoded command to the MUX's
  built-in command table. If <name> already exists as a built-in command,
  such as 'look' or 'WHO', it will actually replace the functionality of
  that command, and all aliases that currently point to it. As in look's
  case, the aliases 'l', 'lo', and 'loo', and the main command 'look' will
  all point to these softcoded commands. The syntax of <thing>/<attribute> is
  like any normal $command.

  For example:

  > &LOOK me=$look:say I looked here!
  > &LOOK_WITH_ARG me=$look *:say I looked at %0!
  > &LOOK_OUTSIDE me=$look/outside *:say I looked outside at %0!
  > @addcommand look=me/look
  > @addcommand look=me/look_with_arg
  > @addcommand look=me/look_outside

{ 'wizhelp @addcommand2' for more }

& @ADDCOMMAND2
@ADDCOMMAND (continued)

  Yes, you can specify more than one attribute to go with <name>. When you
  type 'look' or 'look sofa', the game will execute all attributes that
  match what you have typed in. Aliases like 'l' are expanded to 'look' so
  you don't have to worry about those when you take command matching into
  consideration. If none of the attributes attached match (the attribute
  *must* begin with $<name> in order to match at all!), no output will
  be generated.

  Another use is to speed up use of a particular global command. Just use
  @addcommand to add it to the built-in list, and it will be looked up
  much faster.

& @ADMIN
@ADMIN

  COMMAND: @admin <param>=<value>

  Sets a TinyMUX configuration parameter to the indicated value. Type
  'wizhelp config parameters' for a list of the config parameters that
  may be set.

& @ALLOWANCE
@ALLOWANCE

  ATTRIBUTE: Allowance

  COMMAND: @allowance <object>[=<amount>]

  Sets the amount of money that the player receives each day he/she connects
  to the MUX.  The Allowance attribute overrides the default allowance
  specified by the paycheck config parameter.

  This attribute is only visible and settable by wizards.  It is only
  meaningful for players, and has no effect on other object types.

& @APPLY_MARKED
@APPLY_MARKED

  COMMAND: @apply_marked <command>

  Performs <command> once for each object in the database that has its MARK
  flag set, substituting the characters ## for the object number of the
  marked object.  The command is performed by the player invoking the
  @apply_marked command, not by the marked object.  This command may only
  be used when database cleaning is disabled (via @disable cleaning),
  as cleaning uses the MARKED flag to check connectivity.

  Related Topics: @mark, @mark_all, MARKED.

& @ATTRIBUTE
@ATTRIBUTE

  COMMAND: @attribute[/<switch>] <attrib>[=<value>]

  Performs operations on user-named attributes depending on the switch used.
  The following switches are available:

     /access   - Changes the access to the named attribute.  <value> is a
                 space-separated list of permissions to add or remove from
                 the attribute's access permissions. For a list of possible
                 values, see the related topic given below.

     /delete   - Removes the named attribute from the attribute table.
                 This switch does not remove instances of the attribute from
                 objects, and any that remain will be renamed to the
                 user-named attribute that re-uses the attribute number
                 of the deleted attribute.

     /rename   - Changes the name of the named attribute to <value>.

  Note that changes to user-named attributes performed by this command
  are permanent and do not need to be performed each time the MUX is
  restarted.

& @BACKUP
@BACKUP

  COMMAND: @backup

  This command will dump a flatfile of the database to the data directory.
  The flatfile will be named dump.<date>.tgz. IE, dump.0219-1613.tgz where
  0219-1613 stands for February 19, 4:13pm.

  This file is tarred and gziped. It includes the game flatfile, and the
  mail and comsys databases. It does not include any of the text files, the
  .conf files or the mux.config file. Those would need to be backed up 
  separately.

  Related Topics: 

& @BOOT
@BOOT

  COMMAND: @boot[/quiet] <player>
           @boot/port <port#>

  Severs the named player's connection to the game.  The player is given a
  notice that they have been booted.  If the player is connected to the game
  more than once, then all connections to that player are severed.

  The following switches are available:

    /quiet - Don't give the booted player any special notice.

    /port  - Disconnects only a specific port.  In this case, <port#> must
             be the port number obtained from the SESSION command.

& @CHOWN
@CHOWN

  COMMAND: @chown <object>=<player>

  Wizards may @chown objects, rooms, and exits to other players.
  @Chowned objects are set HALT.

  Related Topics: @chownall.

& @CHOWNALL
@CHOWNALL

  COMMAND: @chownall <victim>[=<recipient>]

  Changes the ownership of all of the victim's objects, rooms, and exits to
  the indicated recipient (or to the wizard performing the @chownall if
  no recipient is specified).  All objects, rooms, and exits are set HALTED.

  Related Topics: @chown.

& @CLONE
@CLONE

  COMMAND: @clone[/<switches>] <object>

  Wizards may also specify the /preserve switch, which preserves the original
  owner of the object in the new copy, instead of creating the copy as being
  owned by the wizard.

& @COMMENT
@COMMENT

  ATTRIBUTE: Comment

  COMMAND: @comment <object>[=<text>]

  Sets a wizard-visible comment on the indicated object. This attribute is
  only visible and settable by wizards.

& @CUT
@CUT

  COMMAND: @cut <object/exit>

  Cuts off the object or exit list for the current location at the indicated
  object or exit by setting [next(thing)] to NOTHING.  Objects or exits that
  follow in the chain are not moved or otherwise changed, and are only
  accessible by object number.  This command is intended for performing
  database repair, and should be used only with extreme caution.

& @DBCK
@DBCK

  COMMAND: @dbck[/full]

  Performs a scan of the database looking for inconsistencies in the object
  chains, disconnected rooms, rooms waiting to be destroyed, and problems in
  the object free list.  Problems that are found are reported to the log
  file, disconnected rooms are reported to their owners, and players are
  credited for rooms destroyed.  Database checks are automatically run
  periodically, so there is usually no need to use this command.

  With the /full switch, @dbck performs more thorough checking, but the
  additional log messages will need more careful consideration and
  interpretation.  Some of these messages can provide very useful insight
  into the state of the database, but it doesn't make sense to run these
  checks automatically.

  Related Topics: @admin, @disable, @enable, @list.

& @DBCLEAN
@DBCLEAN

  COMMAND: @dbclean

  This command searches the entire database and removes any stale
  user-defined attributes.  It should be used sparingly, as it may take many
  minutes to execute, depending upon database size and machine speed.  Only
  God may execute this command.

& @DELCOMMAND
@DELCOMMAND

  COMMAND: @delcommand <name>[=<thing>/<attribute>]

  Deletes a command added by @addcommand.  With only <name> specified,
  deletes all added commands under <name>.  When you specify <thing> and
  <attribute>, it only deletes that specific entry.  If the command or
  commands you are deleting had replaced a built-in command, the built-in
  command and all aliases are restored to their normal names and actions.

  Related Topics: @addcommand, @listcommands.

& @DESTROY
@DESTROY

  COMMAND: @destroy[/<switches>] <object>

  Players are always considered SAFE.  Objects owned by other players are
  not otherwise treated specially.

& @DISABLE
@DISABLE

  COMMAND: @disable <option>

  Turns off the indicated MUX runtime parameter.  The following parameters
  may be turned off:

    building      - Allows players to use the building commands.
    checkpointing - Enables periodic database checkpoint dumping.
    cleaning      - Enables periodic scanning of the database for rooms
                    to be destroyed.
    dequeueing    - Allows commands to be removed from the queue and
                    executed.
    idlechecking  - Enables periodic checking for and booting of idle
                    players.
    interpret     - Enables execution of commands that place commands
                    on the queue.
    logins        - Allows nonwizard players to connect to their characters.
    eventchecking - Enables certain attribute events (@daily, etc) to occur.

  These parameters are all enabled by default.

  Related Topics: @enable, @list.

& @DOING
@DOING

  COMMAND: @doing[/<switch>] <text>

  Wizards may use the /header switch to set the Doing header in the WHO report.
  If no header is specified, the header is reset to "Doing".

& @DUMP
@DUMP

  COMMAND: @dump[/<switches>]

  Writes a checkpoint dump of the database to disk.  Checkpoint dumps are
  automatically performed periodically, so there is usually no need to use
  this command.  Switches may be used to either dump just the structure
  or text portions of the database to disk.  The default is to write out
  both the text and structure portions.

  All of the following switches may by used individually or together:

     flatfile   - Dump an internally consistent flatfile which together
                  with the mail and comsystem databases represent the
                  entire database of game -- useful in a variety of ways
                  including for a backup and for moving from one host to
                  another.
     structure  - Dump the structure portion of the database to a linear
                  human-readable file.
     text       - Ensure that all changes to the text portion of the
                  database are written out to disk.

  Note that the above structure and text options will cause your database and
  certain caches to be out of sync. They should NOT be used in the course
  of normal operation.

  Related Topics: @admin, @disable, @enable, @list, @shutdown.

& @ENABLE
@ENABLE

  COMMAND: @enable <option>

  Turns on the indicated MUX runtime parameter.  The following parameters
  may be turned on:

    building      - Allows players to use the building commands.
    checkpointing - Enables periodic database checkpoint dumping.
    cleaning      - Enables periodic scanning of the database for rooms
                    to be destroyed.
    dequeueing    - Allows commands to be removed from the queue and
                    executed.
    idlechecking  - Enables periodic checking for and booting of idle
                    players.
    interpret     - Enables execution of commands that place commands
                    on the queue.
    logins        - Allows nonwizard players to connect to their characters.
    eventchecking - Enables certain attribute events (@daily, etc) to occur.

  These parameters are all enabled by default.

  Related Topics: @disable, @list.

& @FIXDB
@FIXDB

  COMMAND: @fixdb[/<switch>] <object>=<value>

  This command directly edits the database structure according to the
  switch specified.  As such, it is possible to produce database
  inconsistencies that can hang or crash the server.  This command should
  be used with extreme caution.

  The following switches are available:

     contents     - Sets the contents pointer of <object> to <value>
     exits        - Sets the exits pointer of <object> to <value>
     location     - Sets the location pointer of <object> to <value>
     next         - Sets the next pointer of <object> to <value>
     owner        - Sets the owner of <object> to <value>
     pennies      - Sets the value or wealth of <object> to <value>
     rename       - Renames <object> to <value>

& @FLAG
@FLAG

  Command: @flag[/<switch>] <oldflag>[=<newflag>]

  This command either removes aliases of existing flags, or renames the
  flag.  For example, if you rename CONNECTED to BOBTHEWIZ, then
  whenever you reference the previous 'CONNECTED' flag, it will be seen
  as 'BOBTHEWIZ' instead.  This does not affect the character of 'c'
  for the flag, only the name of it.  This takes effect until the server
  is shutdown or rebooted.  To make a permanent addition, you need to
  use the 'flag_name' config parameter in the conf file.
  The flag name must be no less than three characters, no greater than
  15 characters, and can not be a previously existing flag name.  If
  such a condition exists, it will return an error.

  Switches:
     /remove - used to remove a flag's alias.

  Examples:
    @flag/remove con (removes alias 'con' for 'connected')
    @flag connect=bobthewiz (renames 'connected' to 'bobthewiz')

  Note: the previous naming conventions are referenced automatically as
        aliases for the flag unless specifically removed.

  Related Topics: flag_name.

& @FUNCTION
@FUNCTION

  COMMAND: @function[/<switches>] <function>=<object>/<attr>

  This command displays a list of currently-defined global functions or
  adds a new global function named <function>.  When invoked, the
  arguments to the function are loaded into %0-%9, the <attr> attribute
  from <object> is fetched, and substitution is performed on the
  resulting text.  The result of that substitution is returned as the
  function result.

  If no arguments are given, or if the /list switch is given, the command
  displays a list of the currently-defined global functions. /privileged
  functions are indicated with a 'W' and /preserve functions are indicated
  with a 'p'.

  If the /privileged switch is given, then the new global function is
  evaluated as if the evaluation were being performed by the object on
  which it is stored, instead of as if it were being performed by the
  invoker of the function.  This may be used to allow access to
  information normally available only to wizards.

  The /preserve switch causes r-registers to be preserved across the
  defined function, so you can feel free to use registers in the code
  without worrying about them overwriting previous definitions.

  The function definitions created by @function are not stored in the
  database so they need to be re-created each time the MUX is started.
  It is recommended that the Startup attribute for player #1 include
  code to set up all global functions.

  Function definitions may not be removed (aside from shutting down and
  restarting the MUX, but they may be redefined so that they point to
  an unused attribute.  This command may normally only be invoked by
  player #1.

& @HALT
@HALT

  COMMAND: @halt[/<switches>] [<object>]

  This command can be used to halt commands being run by a specific object,
  all commands being run by objects owned by a specific player, or all
  commands in the game.  If <object> is not specified, the object running
  the command is halted.  If the object being halted is a player, then
  all commands being run by objects owned by that player are halted.
  Halting an object does not affect commands waiting on it as a semaphore,
  use the @drain command to reset a semaphore.

  The /all switch may be used to halt all commands globally.

  Related Topics: @drain, @notify, kill, HALTED, SEMAPHORES.

& @HOOK
@HOOK

  Command: @hook[/<switch(s)>] [<command/attribute>]
  
  This command will set up 'hooks' to be applied to various commands or
  attributes.  You may specify multiple hooks on items.  The HOOK_OBJ is
  an @admin param that specifies the hook object.  The following hooks exist:

         /before    - Set up a BEFORE hook which will execute before the
                      corresponding built-in command/attribute is executed.
                      The HOOK_OBJ attribute is b_<command>.

         /after     - Set up an AFTER hook on a command which will execute
                      after the corresponding built-in command/attribute is
                      executed.  The HOOK_OBJ attribute is a_<command>.

         /permit    - Affects command permission.  Return BOOLEAN TRUE to
                      permit. Return FALSE to notify the enactor with
                      'Permission denied.'.  The HOOK_OBJ attribute is
                      p_<command>.

         /ignore    - Return BOOLEAN FALSE to ignore the corresponding
                      built-in command.  Any matching softcoded commands
                      continue to be handled.  The HOOK_OBJ attribute is
                      i_<command>.

         /igswitch  - Specifies that any non-matching /switch to the command
                      falls through and is handled by softcode.  This allows
                      you to softcode switches to built-in commands.

         /fail      - Set up a FAIL hook which executes if the command is
                      somehow block by a @hook/permit or @icmd/disable.
                      The HOOK_OBJ attribute is af_<command>.

         /clear     - When used in junction with any of the above switches, 
                      will clear the hook from being applied.

         /list      - This lists the current commands/attributes with hooks.

& @ICMD
@ICMD

  Command: @icmd</switch> <player [= arguments]>

  This command sets personal command permissions on a player.
  It only is useful for removing commands and not granting them.
  This command is available only to #1.
  Possible switches are:
    /ON       - Turn on personal command parsing so that it checks
                against invalid commands for the player. (Default)
    /OFF      - Turn off personal command parsing so that commands
                by player parses normally.
    /DISABLE  - Disables the given command so it returns a
                Permission Denied. (Default)
    /IGNORE   - This command actually removes from existence the
                specified commands from the user's standpoint so
                that it is skipped upon command execution checks.
    /CHECK    - Displays a list of the specified players current
                disabled commands and at what level.
                1=disabled   2=ignored
    /CLEAR    - Removes all icmd information from player.

{ Type 'wizhelp @icmd2' for more switches }

& @ICMD2
@ICMD (continued)

  Command: @icmd</switch> <player [= arguments]>
  Continued Switches:

    /IROOM    - This sets commands ignored on the location.
                This is a NON-PLAYER.
    /DROOM    - This sets commands disabled on the location.
                This is a NON-PLAYER.
    /CROOM    - Clears disabled/ignored commands on target location.
                This is a NON-PLAYER.
    /LROOM    - List disabled/ignored commands on target location.
                This is a NON-PLAYER.
    /LALLROOM - List all disabled/ignored commands at location
                and zones from location.  Listings that start with
                'z' are zonemasters.

{ Type 'wizhelp @icmd3' for examples and syntax }

& @ICMD3
@ICMD (continued)

  Command: @icmd</switch> <player [= arguments]>

  The commands can be specified on the player in the form of:
  COMMAND, !COMMAND, COMMAND, ..., etc

  To remove the command from the player, a ! must be specified.
  To change the level from DISABLE to IGNORE or visa versa, it
  must first be REMOVED then ADDED.  For example:

    @icmd/disable TinyJerk=page, whisper, @emit, @pemit
    @icmd/ignore TinyJerk=!@pemit, !@emit, @pemit, @emit

  The above would first set all four to disable.  The second
  would remove @emit and @pemit and then re-add it as ignored.
  The /disable switch is the default and assumed if no switches
  are specified.  All aliases are taken into effect automatically.
  For rooms you could do the following:

    @icmd/droom here=page, whisper, @emit, @pemit
    @icmd/iroom here=!@pemit, !@emit, @pemit, @emit

  Example:  @icmd/ignore majortwit=page,",:,say,pose,@emit,@pemit,whisper,;
            @icmd/ignore dimwit=page,!say,!",pose,:

@LIST ALLOCATIONS

  COMMAND: @list allocations

  This command lists the usage statistics for the internal buffer pools.
  For each buffer pool, the following information is listed:

    Size   - The size of a buffer, in characters.
    InUse  - The number of buffers presently allocated from the pool.
    Total  - The total number of buffers currently in the pool.
    Allocs - The total number of buffers ever allocated from the pool.
    Lost   - The number of buffers lost due to buffer header corruption.

  Information is reported for the following pools:

    Lbufs    - Large buffers, used when handling data input by the user,
               object attributes, the results of interpreting commands, and
               many other places.
    Mbufs    - Medium-sized buffers, for when an sbuf is too small but an lbuf
               is too large.
    Sbufs    - Small buffers, for when you need only a little space.
    Bools    - Boolean expressions, used when evaluating locks.
    Descs    - Network descriptors, one is used for each connected player.
    Qentries - Queue entries, one is used for each command placed on the

     badsite_connect - shown when a connection is opened from a forbidden
                       site.
     connect          - shown when a connection is opened from a site for
                        which registration is not enforced.

                        create a character when the maximum number of connected
                        players are connected.  Note that this is different
                        from what happens when someone tries to connect but
                        there are no free descriptors, which is
                        machine-dependent (usually the connect attempt hangs

& @LOCK
@LOCK

  COMMAND: @lock <object>=<key>

  Note that with attribute locking, a WIZARD object can read any attribute of
  any object, including attributes invisible to players.

  Player #1 may also make attribute locks of the form <attr-num>:<value>
  Note that if <attr-num> is not a valid attribute number, the lock will
  never succeed.

& @LOG
@LOG

  COMMAND: @log <file>=<message>

  This logs the message (without timestamp) to the named file. Pathnames
  are stripped, and the file resides in 'mux2.1/game/logs' under the name
  'M-<file>.log'.

  The file must already exist for the @log request to succeed, and can only
  be created at the MUX account shell.

& @MARK

  COMMAND: @mark[/<switches>] [<player>] [<class>=<restriction>]

  Sets or clears the MARKED flags for objects that match the search criteria.
  This command may only be used when database cleaning is disabled (via
  @disable cleaning), as cleaning uses the MARKED flag to check
  connectivity.

  The following switches are available:

     /set    - (default) Set the MARKED flag on the selected objects.
     /clear  - Clear the MARKED flag on the selected objects.

  Related Topics: @apply_marked, @mark_all, MARKED, SEARCH CRITERIA.

& @MARK_ALL
@MARK_ALL

  COMMAND: @mark_all[/<switches>]

  Sets or clears the MARKED flag for all objects in the database.  This
  command may only be used when database cleaning is disabled (via @disable
  cleaning), as cleaning uses the MARKED flag to check connectivity.

  The following switches are available:

     /set    - (default) Set the MARKED flag on all objects.
     /clear  - Clear the MARKED flag on all objects.

  Related Topics: @apply_marked, @mark_all, MARKED.

& @MOTD
@MOTD

  COMMAND: @motd[/<switches>] <message>

  This command sets or lists short messages that are displayed to players
  after they successfully log in to the game (or after they fail because
  logins are not allowed).  These messages are displayed in addition to
  the contents of the motd.txt and wizmotd.txt files.

  The following switches are available:

     (No switches)   - Sets the message that all players see when they
                       connect.
     /wizard         - Sets the message that wizards see when they connect.
     /down           - Sets the message the players see when they try to
                       connect, but fail because logins are disabled.
     /full           - Sets the message that players see when they try to
                       connect, but fail because there are too many players
                       already connected.

  specified, the player is given a null password.  If logged in, the player
  is notified that his password has been changed.

  Related Topics: @password.

& @PCREATE
@PCREATE

  COMMAND: @pcreate <player>=<password>

  Related Topics: @ps (player version).

& @QUOTA
@QUOTA

  Command: @quota[/<switches>] [<player>[=<quota>]]
           @quota/all[/<switches>] [<quota>]]

  Lists or sets the player's (or everyone's) remaining or total quota
  according to the switches used.

  The following switches are available:

     /all       - Display or set the quota for all players.
     /fix       - Repair the remaining or total quota, assuming that the other
                  is correct.
     /remaining - Set or repair the remaining quota.
     /set       - Set the remaining or total quota to the specified value.

  Related Topics: QUOTAS.

& @READCACHE
@READCACHE

  COMMAND: @readcache

  Reads the commonly-used text files and re-indexes the help files into an
  internal cache.  Use this command whenever you change one of the game's
  text files.

& @RESTART
@RESTART

  COMMAND: @restart

  This command literally restarts the game. To the players, it appears as
  merely a short pause in the action. There are many reasons to @restart,
  including updating the source code, freeing built-up memory, etc.
  @restart dumps and reloads the database, so you cannot use it to change the
  database. You may recompile and use @restart to implement the changes
  without having to @shutdown.

  @restart maintains all connections, any relevant information about them
  across restarts. Nothing should be adversely affected by an @restart.
  However, it should be used sparingly due to the tedious nature of dumping
  and loading the database.

  NOTE: If you update the MUX binary with an outside binary, you should
  never overwrite the old one. Instead, you should delete or move it, and
  place the new binary in its place, for reasons beyond the scope of this
  document. This warning does not apply if you remake the binary in your
  game's source directory.

  Sending the MUX process a SIGUSR1 from the shell account will also cause a
  @restart.

& @SHUTDOWN
@SHUTDOWN

  COMMAND: @shutdown <text>

  Disconnects all connected players, saves the database to disk, and shuts
  down the game.  The game is unavailable until it is restarted.  If an
  argument is specified, it is written to the file named by the status_file
  config directive.

  Related Topics: status_file

& @STARTSLAVE
@STARTSLAVE

  COMMAND: @startslave

  This command restarts the slave process that does user and hostname
  lookups. It should only be used it the slave process has locked up or died
  for some reason.

& @TIMECHECK
@TIMECHECK

  COMMAND: @timecheck[/<switches>]

  An accounting of how much total CPU time has been used to execute commands
  on each object.

  Win9x caveat:  Win9x does not provide a number of how much CPU time the
  MUX game server has consumed and so instead of CPU time, we use a
  high-resolution elapsed time instead. For some CPUs, the resolution of
  this clock can be as high as the processor itself, but as useful as this
  is, this accounting does not make a distinction between time spent in the
  server and time spent in another unrelated application.

  The command takes the following switches:

    /screen     Print information to the screen.
    /log        Print information to the logfile.
    /reset      Clear the counters.

  If no switches are provided, printing to the screen and clearing the
  counters are assumed. The counters are otherwise not cleared unless
  /reset is specified.

& @TIMEOUT
@TIMEOUT

  ATTRIBUTE: Timeout

  COMMAND: @timeout <object>[=<seconds>]

  Sets an idle timeout value on <object> that is different from the default
  value.  If the value is non-numeric or less than or equal to zero, then
  the default value is used.

  This attribute is only visible and settable by wizards.  It is only
  meaningful for players, and has no effect on other object types.

  Related Topics: idle_timeout.

& @TIMEWARP
@TIMEWARP

  COMMAND: @timewarp[/<switches>] <secs>

  Subtracts (or adds if negative) <secs> to one or more internal timers,
  depending on the switches specified from the following list:

     /check    - The time left until the next consistency check and database
                 cleaning.
     /dump     - The time left until the next automatic checkpoint dump.
     /idle     - The time left until the next check for idle users.
     /queue    - (default) Adjusts the time-to-execute for all entries in the
                 wait and semaphore queues.  Entries whose time-to-execute
                 becomes less than the current time are then ready for
                 execution. The contents of the object queue are also
                 appended to the player queue.

  Note: these flags may be specified together if desired.

  Related Topics: @list options.

& @TOAD
@TOAD

  COMMAND: @toad[/<switches>] <victim>[=<recipient>]

  Turns the victim into an object (a slimy toad) and disconnects them from
  the game.  The named recipient (or the @toading wizard) get ownership of
  all the victim's things, rooms, and exits, as well as of the toad object
  itself.

  The following switches are available:

    /no_chown - Don't change the ownership of the victim or his objects.

  Related Topics: @boot, @chownall, @destroy.

& @WALL
@WALL

  COMMAND: @wall[/<switches>] <message>

  With no switches, shouts <message> to every connected player or to every
  connected wizard, prefixed by either 'Announcement:' (if for everyone) or
  'Broadcast:' (if for wizards).  The following switches can be used to get the
  described effects:

     /emit      - Format the message as an emit (ie send just <message>).
     /pose      - Format the message as a pose (ie <yourname> <message>).
     /wizard    - Only send the message to connected wizards.
     /admin     - Send the message to connected wizards and royalty.
     /no_prefix - Don't prepend 'Announcement:' or 'Broadcast:' to the message.

  If neither /emit or /pose are used, you can format the message one of several
  ways by specifying ':', ';', or '"' as the first character of the message.
  ':' and ';' format the message as if /pose were specified, except that ';'
  does not insert a space between your name and the message.  '"' formats the
  message in normal @wall format (this is the default).
  The message is also written to the log file.

& ACCESS
ACCESS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: access <command> <permlist>

  Modifies the permissions needed to execute the indicated command.
  Specifying a permission adds it to the list of permissions required; to
  remove a permission prefix it with a ! character.

  Related Topics: PERMISSIONS, @list.

& ALIAS
ALIAS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: alias <new> <old>.

  Defines the command <new> to be an alias of the command <old>.

  Related Topics: function_alias, flag_alias.

& ALLOW_GUEST_FROM_REGISTERED_SITE
ALLOW_GUEST_FROM_REGISTERED_SITE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: allow_guest_from_registered_site
  DEFAULT: yes.

  With this option turned off, guests are not permitted to connect from
  sites which have been register_site'd.

  Game which use register_site as a more surgical version of forbid_site
  may be interested in turn this option off. However, game which are
  register_only will probably want to leave this option as defaulted.

  Related Topics: register_site, SITE LISTS

& ARTICLE_RULE
ARTICLE_RULE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: article_rule <article> <regular expression>
  DEFAULT: All articles default to a.

  article_rule adds a new rule to the list which the art function uses to
  determine which article to use for a particular word (either a or an). New
  rules are moved to the head of the rule-list so rules appearing later in the
  configuration will override rules at the beginning; hence the most general
  rules should come first followed by a set of exceptions. The art() function
  tests for matches  in order, so only the first matching rule counts.

  <article> is either 'a' or 'an' stating what article to give when art()
  matches input to a rule.

  <regular expression> is a regex which forms the body of the rule.

  For most games the default set of rules in the configuration files should be
  sufficient.

  Example:
    > @admin article_rule=an ^[aeiou]
    > @admin article_rule=an ^herb
    > say art(avocado)
    You say "an"
    > say art(head)
    You say "a"
    > say art(herb)
    You say "an"
    > say art(herbal)
    You say "an"

    dark       - Attribute is not shown or readable to anyone but #1, but
                 anyone can potentially change it.
    deleted    - Attribute should be ignored.  It is not included in the
                 @dump.  Not recommended.  This appears to be a manual way to
                 accomplish @dbclean.
    god        - Only #1 can change the attribute.
    hidden     - Only WIZARDS can see it.  Dark to mortals.
    ignore     - Don't create a @ command for it.  Not recommended.
    internal   - Don't show even to #1.  Internal server bookkeeping.
    is_lock    - Attribute is a lock.  Not recommended.
    locked     - Attribute is locked.
    no_command - Don't process $-commands from this attribute.
    no_inherit - Not inherited by child objects.
    private    - Players other than owner can't see it.
    regexp     - Do a regexp rather than wildcard match.
    visual     - Anyone can see.
    wizard     - Only WIZARDS can change it.

  NOTE: There is a simple way to create attributes that are both 'wizard'
  and 'hidden'. Prefix the attribute name with an underscore (_) and the
  attribute can only be seen or edited by Wizards.

  Example:
    &_myattribute <player>=Only a Wizard can see or change this attribute.

  command reports additional information about the player in the form of flag
  letters between the idle time and the players' Doing string.  The following
  letters may be present:

  D - Player is set DARK.
  d - Player is not shown on the WHO list because they have been idle for
      longer than the default inactivity timeout and the idle_dark_wiz
      configuration parameter has been turned on. (only if not D)
  U - Player is set UNFINDABLE.

& FORK_DUMP
FORK_DUMP

  CONFIG PARAMETER: fork_dump <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: yes

  Indicates whether or not database dumps are to be done by fork()ing off a
  separate process to perform the dump.  While enabling this parameter reduces
  the amount of time needed to perform the dump, it requires that the system
  have enough free swap space to hold a second copy of the running game.

& FULL_FILE
FULL_FILE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: full_file <pathname>
  DEFAULT: text/full.txt

  Specifies the name of the file that is displayed when players attempt to
  connect to a non-wizard character when the number of connected players
  is not less than the number of players allowed by the max_players directive.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

  Related Topics: full_motd_message, max_players.

& FULL_MOTD_MESSAGE
FULL_MOTD_MESSAGE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: full_motd_message <message>
  DEFAULT: blank

  Sets the message that is displayed when a player attempts to connect to a
  non-wizard character when the number of connected players is not less than
  the number of players allowed by the max_players directive.  This message is
  displayed in addition to the contents of the full.txt file.

  Related Topics: down_motd_file, max_players.

& FUNCTION_ACCESS
FUNCTION_ACCESS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: function_access <function> [!]<priv> [[!]<priv>]...

  Changes the privileges needed to call the MUX function <function>.
  If you do not have permission to call a function, the function
  returns the value "#-1 PERMISSION DENIED" instead of the value it
  would normally return.

  Related Topics: @list functions, FUNCTION LIST, PERMISSIONS.

& FUNCTION_ALIAS
FUNCTION_ALIAS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: function_alias <alias> <funcname>

  Defines <alias> as a synonym for the function <funcname>.

  Related Topics: alias, flag_alias.

& FUNCTION_INVOCATION_LIMIT
FUNCTION_INVOCATION_LIMIT

  CONFIG PARAMETER: function_invocation_limit <num>
  DEFAULT: 2500

  This directive sets the maximum number of times that a command may make
  function calls.  If the invocation limit is exceeded, the string
  '#-1 FUNCTION INVOCATION LIMIT EXCEEDED' is returned.  This limit is
  intended to prevent long hangs from creative uses of u() and iter().
  Note: @search is treated specially, each object examined with the
  eval=<arg> parameter is treated as a separate command for the purposes
  of the function invocation limit.

& FUNCTION_RECURSION_LIMIT
FUNCTION_RECURSION_LIMIT

  CONFIG PARAMETER: function_recursion_limit <num>
  DEFAULT: 50

  This directive sets the maximum number of nested function calls that
  may be made before the function call is aborted and the string
  '#-1 FUNCTION RECURSION LIMIT EXCEEDED' is returned.  Normally this is not
  a problem, but the u() function can be used to cause infinite recursion
  (unless blocked by a recursion limit)

& GAME_DIR_FILE
GAME_DIR_FILE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: game_dir_file <path>

  This configuration option specifies the file name of the 'directory' portion
  of the CHashFile attribute database. If this file is deleted, CHashFile will
  automatically re-created it.

  It is read into memory at startup and re-written during page splits in the
  'pages' portion of the database.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

  Related Topics: game_pag_file

& GAME_PAG_FILE
GAME_PAG_FILE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: game_pag_file <path>

  This configuration option specifies the file name of the 'pages' portion of
  the CHashFile attribute database. Unlike the 'directory' portion, this
  portion cannot be replaced. Attribute values themselves are stored in this
  file.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

  Related Topics: game_dir_file

& GDBM_DATABASE
GDBM_DATABASE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: gdbm_database <path>

  MUX 2.0 maintains a database in a different way. This configuration
  option is obsolete.

& GIVE
GIVE

  COMMAND: give[/<switches>] <who> = <what>

  Wizards may use the /quiet switch to suppress the 'You give X to P' and
  'P gave you X' messages.  Other messages related to giving objects
  (such as the xDROP and XSUCC attributes on the object being given, or
  error messages) are not suppressed.

& GLOBAL_ERROR_OBJ
GLOBAL_ERROR_OBJ

  CONFIG DIRECTIVE: global_error_obj <dbref>
  DEFAULT: -1

  Specifies the object that it looks for, to evaluate an attribute
  whenever a 'Huh? (Type 'help' for help)' would have shown up.
  The attribute is the VA attribute (settable by @va or &va), and
  will evaluate like you would in a @pemit, think, or other command.
  The enactor is %#, though it is evaluated by the object itself.
  This _CAN_ be a security risk if not done properly, but is done
  that way on purpose.  The string they typed will be passed as %0.
  It will be unevaluated and 'as-is'.

  Why the VA attribute?  Why not?  I felt it was being all alone
  and left out of the fun ;)

  Original code and helpfile from RhostMUSH. Used with permission.

  Example:
    > @admin global_error_obj=10
    Set.
    > @va #10=[pemit(%#,You typed '%0')]
    Set.
    > @pemit me=Test
    Test
    > @pmit me=Test
    You typed '@pmit me=Test'

& GOOD_NAME
GOOD_NAME

  CONFIG PARAMETER: good_name <name>

  Removes <name> from the list of names that may not be used as a player
  name, reversing the effect of a bad_name directive.  The name must match
  exactly (wildcard matching is not performed).

& GUESTS_CHANNEL
GUESTS_CHANNEL

  CONFIG PARAMETER: guests_channel <name>
  DEFAULT: Guests

  Specifies the name of the channel that guests join when they connect. You
  must have created the channel already. To disable this feature, simply set
  this parameter to nothing.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

  Related Topics: public_channel.

& GUEST_CHAR_NUM
GUEST_CHAR_NUM

  CONFIG PARAMETER: guest_char_num <number>
  DEFAULT: (none)

  Indicates the database reference number of the guest character.  If set,
  the specified guest character is subject to additional restrictions (such
  as not being allowed to create or destroy objects).  The actual
  restrictions can be changed with the access config parameter using the
  no_guest permission.

& GUEST_FILE
GUEST_FILE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: guest_file <path>
  DEFAULT: text/guest.txt

  Specifies the file that is to be shown to people connecting to the
  guest character in place of the motd file.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

  Related Topics: guest_char_num.

& GUEST_NUKER
GUEST_NUKER

  CONFIG PARAMETER: guest_nuker <num>
  DEFAULT: 1

  Specifies who is to nuke guests when they log off. If it is not a good
  object or a wizard, it defaults to #1.

  Related Topics: guest_char_num, guest_prefix, number_guests, min_guests,
                  guest_site.

&GUEST_PREFIX
GUEST_PREFIX

  CONFIG PARAMETER: guest_prefix <name>
  DEFAULT: Guest

  Specifies the prefix for all guests. This will be what is put before the #
  when the guest is created. This will also be what is used to connect to
  the guests on your system.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

  Related Topics: guest_char_num, number_guests, min_guests, guest_site.

& GUEST_SITE

& HAVE_COMSYS
HAVE_COMSYS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: have_comsys <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: yes

  Specifies whether or not the comsystem should be active.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

  Related Topics: comsys_database, have_macros.

& HAVE_MAILER
HAVE_MAILER

  CONFIG PARAMETER: have_mailer <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: yes

  Specifies whether @mail and mail aliases should be active.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

  Related Topics: mail_database

& HAVE_ZONES
HAVE_ZONES

  CONFIG PARAMETER: have_zones <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: yes

  Specifies whether zones should be active. If this is off, zone connects
  and disconnects, zone commands, and the control aspects will all be
  disabled.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

& HELPFILE
HELPFILE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: helpfile <command> <pathname>
  DEFAULT: None

  This configuration directive associates the in-game command, <command>, with
  a set of help topics contained in the file <pathname>.txt.  By default,
  <command> has 'public' permissions, but this can be further restricted with
  the 'access' configuration directive.

  The associated <command> will have one of the following forms:

    <command> <topic>
    <command> <topic wildcard pattern>

  Unlike raw_helpfile, the associated helpfile <command> evaluates the <topic>
  before giving the result to the player.  To avoid this evaluation, use the
  raw_helpfile configuration directive instead.

  The default configuration file contains the following lines already, but
  the base server does not setup any help files (including help, wizhelp, or
  news).  Therefore, make sure that your older configuration files contain
  at least the following lines:

    raw_helpfile help text/help
    raw_helpfile wizhelp text/wizhelp
    access wizhelp wizard

  Also, in order for the help aliases in alias.conf to be setup properly,
  the three above lines must occur before alias.conf is included.

  To prevent access to arbitrary files after the server has started, this
  configuration directive cannot be used by via @admin after the server has
  started.

  Examples:
     helpfile wiznews text/wiznews
     access wiznews wizard

  Related Topics: access, raw_helpfile

& HOOK SETUP
HOOK SETUP

  Hooks are set up by following the shown methods.
  1)  You must first create and setup a hook object to store the data.
      Once you have @created the object, the object needs to be defined
      with the 'HOOK_OBJ' admin parameter.  This may be placed in the 
      .conf file or done via @admin.

  2)  You must set up hooks for the commands/attributes you wish to use.
      The hooks are 'permit', 'ignore', 'before', 'after', and 'igswitch'.
      See wizhelp on 'hook_cmd' on more info of these switchtypes.
      You may use the @hook command, or use the hook_cmd admin parameter
      to place in a .conf file.

  3)  The PERMIT and IGNORE config params are 'enabled' if they return 
      anything but a 'NULL' or a '1'.

  4)  The IGSWITCH config parameter is a toggle only.

  5)  The BEFORE and AFTER switches are automatically processed if existing.

  6)  The following attributes on the global hook object (hook_obj) exist:
         I_<command> - ignore            P_<command> - permit
         A_<command> - after             B_<command> - before

{ see 'wizhelp hook setup2' for examples }

& HOOK SETUP2
HOOK SETUP (continued)

  > @create HookObject
  HookObject created as object #1234
  > &a_look #1234=[pemit(%#,-- After The Look --)]
  > &b_look #1234=[pemit(%#,-- Before The Look --)]
  > &i_look #1234=[gt(match(v(is-ignored),%#),0)]
  > &p_look #1234=[gt(match(v(is-forbidden),%#),0)]
  > &is-ignored #1234=#5 #8 #9 #12   (this gets 'Huh? (type 'help' for help)')
  > &is-forbidden #1234=#6 #10 #15   (this gets 'Permission denied.')
  > @set #1234=sidefx                (needed to use side-effects like pemit())

  Now you can do one of two things:
  > @hook/before look
  > @hook/after look
  > @hook/ignore look
  > @hook/permit look
  OR...
  > @admin hook_cmd look before after ignore permit

  There, your hook object is all set up.  If you want it to last through
  reboots, you need to either put the @hook's in a @startup, or add the 
  hook_cmd to the .conf file.  You probably want the hook_cmd :)
 
  Related Topics: @hook, hook_cmd, hook_obj.

& HOOK_CMD
HOOK_CMD

  Config parameter: hook_cmd <command> <hooks/!hooks>
  This admin parameter allows you to specify multiple hooks for commands
  or attributes in the .conf file or online via @admin.  This is an 
  alternative way to applying hooks besides the @hook command.
  The following hooks exist:
         - before      set up functionality BEFORE a command executes.
         - after       set up functionality AFTER a command executes.
         - permit      establish functionary lock of attribute/command.
         - ignore      establish ignore inheritance of attribute/command.
         - igswitch    specifies if command bypasses failed /switch notices.

& HOOK_OBJ
HOOK_OBJ

  Config parameter: hook_obj <dbref>.  Default: -1
  Specifies the valid dbref# that the hook information is stored.  All
  hooks are in the form <prefix>_<command/attribute>.  
  Attributes are stored in the form:
          I_<command> - ignore configuration
          P_<command> - permit configuration
          A_<command> - after configuration
          B_<command> - before configuration

  DEFAULT: 60

  Sets the interval between checks for idle users.

  Related Topics: conn_timeout, idle_timeout.

& IDLE_TIMEOUT
IDLE_TIMEOUT

  CONFIG PARAMETER: idle_timeout <secs>
  DEFAULT: 3600 (one hour)

  Sets the amount of time that a player may remain idle before being
  automatically disconnected.  Players idle longer than this parameter are
  disconnected when the next check for idle players is done.

  Related Topics: conn_timeout, idle_interval.

& IDLE_WIZ_DARK
IDLE_WIZ_DARK

  CONFIG PARAMETER: idle_wiz_dark <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: no

  Indicates whether or not wizards or players with the idle power who are
  idle for longer than the default timeout value are to automatically be
  set DARK, and then unDARKed when they type in their next command. Wizards
  already set DARK are not automatically unDARKed. Any player who is set
  dark by this action will have a 'd' instead of a 'D' by their idle time
  in the privileged WHO listing.

& INCLUDE
INCLUDE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: include <path>
  DEFAULT: none

  Reads and processes configuration directives from the named file.
  This directive is only valid during startup.

& INDENT_DESC
INDENT_DESC

  CONFIG PARAMETER: indent_desc <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: no

  Places a blank row before and after every room, object, and exit
  description when looked at.

& INHERIT
INHERIT

  FLAG: INHERIT(I) (all types)

  When set on an object, gives the object access to the WIZARD and IMMORTAL
  powers that its owner has, and also allows that object to control the player
  and other INHERIT objects owned by that player.

  When set on a player, gives all of that player's objects access to the
  WIZARD and IMMORTAL powers of their owner, and allows them to control the
  player or any object owned by the player.

& INHERITANCE
INHERITANCE

  This topic intentionally left blank.

& INITIAL_SIZE
INITIAL_SIZE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: initial_size <number>
  DEFAULT: 1000

  This is the number of objects that can be created before the database
  structure has to be reallocated again. This is needed since MUX allocates
  space for the database in large chunks, the size of which depends on
  this parameter.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

& INPUT_DATABASE
INPUT_DATABASE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: input_database
  DEFAULT: netmux.db

  Specifies the name of the database file that is read in at startup.
  This file is used only as an input file, the parameter output_database
  controls where updated copies of the database are written.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

& KILL_GUARANTEE_COST
KILL_GUARANTEE_COST

  CONFIG PARAMETER: kill_guarantee_cost <amount>
  DEFAULT: 100

  Specifies the amount of money you have to spend (i.e., kill target =
  <amount>) to have a 100% chance of killing them (assuming there are no
  other factors, such as the victim being immortal or in a HAVEN room, etc).
  The chance of a successful kill is <amount spent> / <kill_guarantee_cost>.

                  KILLING.

& KILL_MAX_COST
KILL_MAX_COST

  CONFIG PARAMETER: kill_max_cost <amount>
  DEFAULT: 100

  Specifies the maximum amount of money that may be usefully spent on a kill
  attempt.  Spending more than this amount does not improve the chance of
  success.  Setting this parameter to less than the kill_guarantee_cost
  parameter prevents 'automatic kills', as the kill will always have a chance
  of failing.

  Related Topics: kill, kill_guarantee_cost, kill_min_cost, HAVEN, IMMORTAL,
                  KILLING.

& KILL_MIN_COST
KILL_MIN_COST

  CONFIG PARAMETER: kill_min_cost <amount>
  DEFAULT: 10

  Specifies the minimum (and default) cost for attempting to kill someone or
  something.

  Related Topics: kill, kill_guarantee_cost, kill_max_cost, HAVEN, IMMORTAL,
                  KILLING.

& LAG_MAXIMUM
LAG_MAXIMUM

  CONFIG DIRECTIVE: lag_maximum <seconds>
  DEFAULT: 120.000

  Controls when to log expensive commands.  Any command taking longer than
  <seconds> is logged.  Note that the resolution of <seconds> is 100ns
  which is the 7th decimal place to the right of the decimal point.

  Examples:
     lag_maximum 1.2
     @admin lag_maximum=0.750

& LINK_COST
LINK_COST

  CONFIG PARAMETER: link_cost <amount>
  DEFAULT: 1

  Specifies the cost of using the @link command to establish or change the
  link of an exit to its destination, the home of a player or an object, or
  the drop-to of a room.

  Related Topics: @link.

& LIST_ACCESS
LIST_ACCESS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: list_access <param> [!]<privilege> [[!]<privilege>]...

  Changes the access needed to the <param> option of the @list command.

  Related Topics: @list, PERMISSIONS.

& LOCK_RECURSION_LIMIT
LOCK_RECURSION_LIMIT

  CONFIG PARAMETER: lock_recursion_limit <num>
  DEFAULT: 20

  Sets the maximum number of levels of indirection that may be used when
  using indirect locks.  If more than this many levels are used, the lock
  fails and the user gets an error message.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

& LOG
LOG

  CONFIG PARAMETER: log [!]<logoption> [[!]<logoption>]...

  Specifies what types of events are to be logged to the logfile.

    accounting     - Write an accounting record to the log for each player
                     who disconnects.

    network        - Record new and broken net connections.
    problems       - Record problems found with the database.
    security       - Record security-related events.
    shouts         - Record uses of the @wall command.
    startup        - Record information about game startup.
    suspect        - Record commands entered by players flagged SUSPECT.
    wizard         - Record uses of dangerous commands like @toad.

  Related Topics: log_options.

& LOGGING
LOGGING
 
  There are two separate forms of logging.  Firstly, server-related logging is
  controlled with the two configuration parameters: 'log_options' and 'log'.
  Secondly, softcode may use the @log command to send arbitrary text to
  arbitrary log files.  The former style of logging automatically breaks into
  500KB chunks.  The latter style does not.

  In the first style, the log_options parameter controls the information that
  is written along with the message in the logfile.  By default, log_options
  is configured to write the timestamp of the log message and the location of
  referenced players and objects.

  The log_options parameter controls what type of information is written to 
  the logfile.  Many different types of log information can be stored.  By
  default, log_options is configured to record the following events:  bugs, 
  security, network, logins, checkpoints, config_changes, shouts, startup,
  wizard, suspect_commands, problems, and create.  See 'wizhelp log' for 
  specifics on the information stored by these event types. 

  Of note, the log configuration option of 'all_commands' can be used to 
  monitor every command issued by every player on the game when strange
  activity is occuring.   Doing so, however, may raise privacy concerns.  
  Use with caution.  If a single individual is in question, use of the
  SUSPECT flag and suspect_commands event logging is suggested.

  Related Topics: log, log_options, @log, @list logging.

& LOGOUT_CMD_ACCESS
LOGOUT_CMD_ACCESS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: logout_cmd_access <command> <permlist>

  Specifies permission for logged-out commands, like WHO, DOING, SESSION,
  QUIT, OUTPUTPREFIX, and OUTPUTSUFFIX.

  Related Topics: access.

& LOGOUT_CMD_ALIAS
LOGOUT_CMD_ALIAS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: logout_cmd_alias <alias> <command>

  Makes <alias> an alias for <command>, where <command> is one of WHO, DOING,
  SESSION, QUIT, OUTPUTPREFIX, and OUTPUTSUFFIX.

& LOG_OPTIONS
LOG_OPTIONS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: log_options [!]<option> [[!]<option>]...

  Specifies the type of information to be included in each log entry.
  The possible values are:

    flags       - Include the flags set on a player or object.
    location    - Include the location of referenced players and objects.
    owner       - Include the owner of referenced players and objects.
    timestamp   - Include a timestamp in each log entry.

  Related Topics: log.

& LOOK_OBEY_TERSE
LOOK_OBEY_TERSE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: look_obey_terse <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: YES

  Indicates whether or not the 'look' command obeys the TERSE flag when
  deciding how much information to display.  If set to yes, the
  terse_shows_contents, terse_shows_exits, and terse_shows_move_messages
  config options control the amount of information displayed for TERSE
  players.

  Related Topics: terse_shows_contents, terse_shows_exits,
                  terse_shows_move_messages.

& MACHINE_COMMAND_COST
MACHINE_COMMAND_COST

  CONFIG PARAMETER: machine_command_cost <number>
  DEFAULT: 64

  Sets the cost for running a command from a machine, as opposed to running
  it interactively.  Each command run has a one in <number> chance of being
  charged one coin for machine overhead.

& MAIL_DATABASE
MAIL_DATABASE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: mail_database <path>
  DEFAULT: mail.db

  Sets the file that @mail information is to be stored in. The database
  is only loaded or saved if have_mailer is set to yes.

  Related Topics: have_mailer.

& MAIL_EXPIRATION
MAIL_EXPIRATION

  CONFIG PARAMETER: mail_expiration <number of days>
  DEFAULT: 14

  Sets the number of days that a @mail message should last before it is
  automatically deleted by the system. If this parameter is set to a
  negative number, this feature will be disabled.

& MARKED
MARKED

  FLAG: MARKED(m) (all types)

  This flag is used by the database cleaning routines to check the
  connectivity of the database, and also by the @mark commands to select
  objects for special attention.  Since database cleaning is performed
  automatically from time to time, automatic cleaning must be disabled
  before using the @mark commands, and the command @mark_all/clear should
  be run immediately before turning automatic cleaning back on.

  Related Topics: @apply_marked, @dbck, @disable, @enable, @list, @mark,
                  @mark_all.

& MASTER_ROOM
MASTER_ROOM

  CONFIG PARAMETER: master_room <roomnum>
  DEFAULT: (none)

  Specifies the room that is searched for exits if a command does not match
  an exit in the current room, and for $-command if a command does not match
  any $-commands that are available to the player in his current location.

  Note: Do not prefix <roomnum> with a '#' character. Even though it is a
  dbref of the master room, it must be given here as a number.

& MASTER ROOM
MASTER ROOM

  The master room contains the default exits and $-commands for the MUX.  The
  exits in the master room are checked if a command doesn't match an exit in
  the player's current room, and the $-commands on the room and its contents.

  Caution: Do not allow players into the master room, as they can leave
  objects that will be searched for $-commands.  Make sure that the room is
  not JUMP_OK or LINK_OK, and that any exits leading to the room are locked
  so that only wizards may use them.

  To make global commands, make an exit in the master room that is locked to
  #0 (or some other impossible lock) and has an appropriate Afail action (and
  possibly Fail and Ofail messages).  You can make global exits by having an
  unlocked exit from the master room (or an exit locked to a desired key
  object) lead to the desired destination.  When a player goes through one of
  these exits, any KEY objects are returned home, as is done with @teleport.

  Do not put too many objects in the room, because each object is searched
  for $-command every time anyone (or anything) anywhere on the MUX enters

& PERMISSIONS
PERMISSIONS

  Access to many MUX features is controlled by a set of permissions, which
  can usually be changed via the configuration file or the @admin command.

  There are three different senses of Wizard:

    1) 'WIZARD' means the WIZARD flag,

    2) 'Wizard' means Wizard-level authority which can be achieved either by
       being set WIZARD or by inheriting that authority from a WIZARD-owned
       object with the INHERIT flag, and

    3) Wizard(#1) who is always set WIZARD and has other special privileges.


  The following list uses two of those senses: 'Wizard' and Wizard(#1).

  This is a list of the valid permissions and their meanings:

    builder        - Must be Wizard, ROYALTY, or have the BUILDER power.
    dark           - Feature is not shown but is still available.
    disabled       - No one can use this feature.

  look at a room.  It does not affect the inventory or examine commands,
  both of which show all objects.

& SESSION
SESSION

  COMMAND: SESSION <prefix>

  The SESSION command displays character input and output information for
  all connected players, or just those who match <prefix>.

  This command can be used to help identify network problems as follows:

    - A nonzero Input Pending count can indicate typeahead or a
      client program dumping commands faster than the command scheduling
      parameters let them be executed.  Telnet sessions in character mode also
      show up with positive Input Pending counts when the player is in the
      middle of typing a command.
    - A nonzero Input Lost count means that the player has typed a line longer
      than what the MUX can handle.  This usually indicates a problem with
      the player's client or terminal (a stuck key).
    - A persistently large Output Pending count can indicate netlag between
      the host site and the player's site, or merely that the player has
      performed a command that generated a lot of output which hasn't been
      sent yet.
    - A nonzero Output Lost count usually means that the player performed
      a command that produced more output than the output buffer could hold.
      It may also indicate network problems or that the player is generating
      output faster than the network or his client can process it.

& SIGNAL_ACTION
SIGNAL_ACTION

  CONFIG PARAMETER: signal_action <default|exit>
  DEFAULT: default

  Specifies what action to take when a fatal signal is received.  The
  possibilities are:

     default  - Log the error, produce a panic dump, dump a core file, and
                restart the game using the last reliably saved database.
                For a description of the restart process, see @restart.
     exit     - Log the error, and exit, hopefully with a core file.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

& SITE LISTS
SITE LISTS

  Site lists match the numeric IP address of the connecting player, and help
  to manage client access to the MUX.

  There are two site lists:

      Access Control List  - forbid_site, permit_site, register_site,
                             guest_site, nositemon_site.
      Suspects             - suspect_site and trust_site

  Both contain an ordered list of 'sites', 'subnets', or 'hosts' specified
  with a notation explained in the 'SITE NOTATION' topic.

  Each site in the list is matched in the order it appears in the
  configuration file, and the first one that matches is used.  Therefore, you
  should put the more narrowly-defined sites before the more broadly-defined
  ones. Otherwise, the more narrowly-defined site (the one covering a subset
  of IP addresses within the more broadly-defined site) will never be in
  force.

  Additions made to the lists after startup with the @admin command are put
  at the front of the list, and are checked before entries from the config
  file and previous entries made by the @admin command.

  forbid_site    135.246.4.0  255.255.255.0    <- Disallow a class C subnet
  permit_site    135.246.0.0  255.255.0.0      <- Permit a class B network
  register_site  195.3.17.1   255.255.255.255  <- Permit this site w/reg.
  forbid_site    0.0.0.0      0.0.0.0          <- Disallow everyone else
 
  These directives only allow access from 135.346.*.* and 195.3.17.1, except
  that all hosts in the 135.246.4 subnet except for 135.246.4.40 are also
  not allowed access.  People connecting from 135.246.4.40 and 195.3.17.1
  are not allowed to create their own characters (registration is enabled
  for those sites), while people connecting from elsewhere on the 135.246
  net are allowed to create their own characters.

& SITE NOTATION
SITE NOTATION

 Site notation specifies a range of numeric IP addresses.  A particular range
 can include a single IP address or the entire Internet.

 There are several variations:

   <address> <mask>    - The <address> and <mask> are both dotted IPv4
                         notation, but the <mask> is further restricted that
                         it's '1' bits are all together and form a prefix.
                         The <mask> specifies which bits in the <address> are
                         significant.

   <address>/<N>       - The <address> is a dotted IPv4 number, but <N> is an
                         integer from 0 to 32 that specifies the number of
                         significant bits in left-most part of the <address>.
                         This notation is called CIDR IP prefix notation or
                         'slash notation'.

& SITE NOTATION2
SITE NOTATION (continued)

 Four forms of dotted IPv4 addresses are allowed:

   8.8.8.8, 8.8.16, 8.24 and 32.

 8 means an 8-bit integer from 0 to 255, 16 means a 16-bit integer
 from 65536, etc. The 8.8.8.8 form is the most common. The latter three
 originated on BSD.

 Furthermore, the integer can be expressed in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal
 notation. Hexadecimal numbers have a '0x' prefix. Octal numbers have a '0'
 prefix.

 Examples:

   135.246.4.40 255.255.255.255   - Single host.
   135.246.4.0  0xFF.255.0777.0   - Class C subnet.
   135.246.4.0/24                 - Same as above in CIDR IP format.
   135.246.0/16                   - Class B subnet.
   135.0/8                        - Class A subnet in CIDR IP format.
   0 0                            - The entire Internet
   0/0                            - Same as above in CIDR IP format.

& SITE_CHARS
SITE_CHARS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: site_chars <number>

  listing. If <number> is 0, then the hostname will be shown in full.

& SLAY
SLAY

  COMMAND: slay <player/object>

  Kills the indicated player or object without paying any insurance to the
  victim.  It should be used in places where suicide should not be rewarded.

  CONFIG PARAMETER: space_compress <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: yes

  Specifies whether or not extra spaces are to be removed from user input
  as it is processed.  If enabled, multiple spaces are compressed to a single
  space, and spaces at the ends of strings are removed.

& STACK_LIMIT
STACK_LIMIT

  CONFIG PARAMETER: stack_limit <number>
  DEFAULT: 50

  The number of items that are allowed on an object's stack. You should be
  sparse with this parameter, as stack items are retained until they are
  removed.

& STARTING_MONEY

  Sets the building quota that players receive when they are created, whether
  by @pcreate or the connection screen.

  Related Topics: @quota, quotas.

& STARTUP
STARTUP

  FLAG: STARTUP(z) (all types)

  This flag is managed internally by the server and it is not directly
  settable.  It indicates whether or not the object has a STARTUP attribute
  that is to be run when the MUX is booted.  This saves a considerable amount
  of time considering that very few objects have a STARTUP attribute.
  This flag is set automatically when the STARTUP attribute is set to a
  non-empty string, and cleared when the STARTUP attribute is removed or
  set to a null string.

  Related Topics: @startup.

& STATUS_FILE
STATUS_FILE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: status_file <filename>
  DEFAULT: shutdown.status

  If you give an argument to the @shutdown command, that argument is written
  out to the file named by this directive.  The file can be used by an
  auto-restart script to decide whether or not to bring the MUX back up,
  for instance.

  This configuration option cannot be changed after the server starts.  It
  can only be changed via the configuration file.

& SUSPECT
SUSPECT

  FLAG: SUSPECT(u) (players)

  CONFIG PARAMETER: terse_shows_contents <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: yes

  Indicates whether or not to suppress the listing of a location's contents
  when producing TERSE output (whether from an automatic look or a 'real'
  look if look_obey_terse is turned on.

  Indicates whether or not to suppress the listing of a location's obvious
  exits when producing TERSE output (whether from an automatic look or a
  'real' look if look_obey_terse is turned on.

  Related Topics: look_obey_terse, terse_shows_contents,
                  terse_shows_move_messages.

& TERSE_SHOWS_MOVE_MESSAGES
TERSE_SHOWS_MOVE_MESSAGES

  CONFIG PARAMETER: terse_shows_move_messages <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: yes

  Indicates whether or not to suppress messages related to moving about
  produced by locations and exits.  These messages are the ENTER and LEAVE
  messages on locations, and the SUCC and DROP messages on exits.
  The messages seen by others (Oxxx attributes) and the actions to be
  performed (Axxx attributes) are unaffected.

  Related Topics: look_obey_terse, terse_shows_contents, terse_shows_exits.

& THING_FLAGS
THING_FLAGS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: thing_flags <flags>.
  DEFAULT: blank

  Modifies the set of flags that a thing receives when it is @created.
  Flags prefixed by a ! remove the indicated flag from the set.

  Related Topics: @list, exit_flags, player_flags, robot_flags, room_flags.

& THING_QUOTA

& TIMESLICE
TIMESLICE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: timeslice <milliseconds>
  DEFAULT: 1000

  Specifies the interval (in milliseconds) at which connected users' command
  quotas are increased.  Each command a user types in (commands executed by
  machines do not count) decreases that user's quota by 1, and the user's
  commands are only executed if the quota is greater than zero.

  Related Topics: command_quota_incr, command_quota_max.

& TOAD_RECIPIENT
TOAD_RECIPIENT

  CONFIG PARAMETER: toad_recipient <player dbref>

  This is a configuration parameter; as such dbrefs should be given as the raw
  number and not be preceded by the usual '#' (this is interpreted the
  beginning of a comment by the config file parser).

  Default: #-1 (-1)

  When a player is @toaded (or @nuked) his or her property is normally @chowned
  to another player; toad_recipient controls who the recipient of the player's
  objects are. If the value is set to -1 the @toading wizard will get ownership
  of all the victim's objects, otherwise the specified player gets ownership.
  This can be explicitly overridden by providing a recipient with the @toad
  command.

  @toad/@nuke are potential security risks as they normally change the
  ownership of a victim (a non-privileged character and presumably untrusted
  player) to a player with wizard permissions. Furthermore, this can cause
  clutter and it can be often difficult to sort out unwanted objects after an
  @toading.

  It is recommended that games create a non-privileged character for the
  express purpose of being a toad_recipient.

  Example:
   > @pcreate Nobody=noone
   New player 'Nobody' created with password 'noone'
             (dbref of #57)

   > @admin toad_recipient=57

& TRACE_OUTPUT_LIMIT
TRACE_OUTPUT_LIMIT

  CONFIG PARAMETER: trace_output_limit <amount>
  DEFAULT: 200

  Specifies the maximum number of lines of trace output that will be displayed
  when using top-down format.  Bottom-up format output is not affected by this
  parameter.

  Note that this parameter is intended as a limit on the amount of memory used
  to store intermediate data and not on the quantity of trace output, top-down
  format needs to keep all intermediate results in memory before displaying
  them, while bottom-up format displays them immediately after generating them.

  When trace output lines are discarded, only the last (trace_output_limit)
  lines are kept.  These lines contain information about the evaluations done
  earliest in the process of evaluating the expression (usually the innermost
  evaluations and earlier arguments of outer functions).

& TRACE_TOPDOWN
TRACE_TOPDOWN

  CONFIG PARAMETER: trace_topdown <yes/no>
  DEFAULT: yes

  Specifies whether TRACE output is displayed top-down (complete evaluation
  shown first, followed by sub-evaluations), or bottom-up (sub-evaluations
  shown first, followed by the larger evaluation of which they are a part).

& TRUST_SITE
TRUST_SITE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: trust_site <site>

& UNOWNED_SAFE
UNOWNED_SAFE

  CONFIG PARAMETER: unowned_safe <yes/no>.
  DEFAULT: no

  Indicates whether or not objects not owned by you are automatically
  considered SAFE.  (This parameter only affects wizards)  Note that players
  are always considered SAFE, and DESTROY_OK things are never considered SAFE.

  Related Topics: @destroy, DESTROY_OK, SAFE.

& USER_ATTR_ACCESS
USER_ATTR_ACCESS

  CONFIG PARAMETER: user_attr_access [!]<privilege> [[!]<privilege>]...

& WAIT_COST
WAIT_COST

  CONFIG PARAMETER: wait_cost <amount>.
  DEFAULT: 10

  Sets the amount of money that it costs to run the @wait command and other
  actions that add commands to the queue.  The money is refunded when the
  command is removed from the queue (either when it is executed or by @halt).

  Related Topics: @wait.

WHO

  COMMAND: WHO <prefix>

  The WHO command returns miscellaneous information about connected players.
  It returns the player name, connect time, idle time, and player flags just
  like the player WHO command (which is available as the DOING command), but
  returns the following information in place of the player's Doing string:

     Room         - The room that the player is in.
     Commands     - The number of commands that the player has entered during
                    this session (not counting machine commands).
     Host flags   - located between the Commands and Host fields:
                    F(forbidden), R(registration), +(suspect).
     Host         - The Internet host name or address from where the player has
                    connected.

& WIZARD
WIZARD

  FLAG: WIZARD(W) (all types)

  A player or object that is set WIZARD controls all of the objects in the
  database (except for player #1), regardless of their ownership or flags.
  In general, WIZARDs can do anything using #<number> or *<player>.
  Wizards can also use many additional commands that are useful for game
  administration and maintenance.
  Only player #1 can set or clear this flag.  An object owned by a Wizard has
  wizard privileges only if its WIZARD or INHERIT flag is set, or if the
  owning Wizard has his INHERIT flag set.
