# Welcome:

Everyone has been running the ALPHA for years. It is way past time to
go through an official release process. The only recent changes are
build-related fixes.

# README Files:

Remember all the various README files. They may be a tad stale, but
they can still be useful, and let's begin freshening them up.

# Whether you start a new game or port an existing one:

 - Make backups. Frequent and complete. It is important.
 - Store your backups off site. This was always prudent anyway.
 - Run your game as usual.
 - Report bugs to brazilofmux@gmail.com.
