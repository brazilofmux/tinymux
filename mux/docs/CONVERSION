TinyMUX 2.12: CONVERSION
Last Update: July 2012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conversions from Other Database Formats:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TinyMUX 2.12 has been proven to read the following database formats:
   TinyMUX 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 2.10

Upgrading An Existing TinyMUX:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - @shutdown the game. Make a flatfile of your DB and move it to a safe
   location.

 - Compile TinyMUX 2.12 per INSTALL.  Note that TinyMUX 2.12 untars into a
   separate directory.

 - Copy the flatfile to game/data in the TinyMUX 2.12 directory and use
   db_load to convert the database to binary.

 - Copy .txt files to text/

 - Copy existing mux.config

 - **Important** Your old GAMENAME.conf file will not work under TinyMUX 2.12
   if you are converting from a version prior to TinyMUX 2.0.

   To make a proper file, you must edit the GAMENAME.conf in the TinyMUX 2.12
   game/ and add in the config parameters.

 - You can save a little time by 'cat oldfile >> newfile' and using
   the editor to remove unneeded lines.

 - Copy any existing comsys.db and mail.db files to game/data.  If your
   game comes up and the mail and/or comsys are not working, make sure
   that you put the files in the right directory and restart the TinyMUX.

 - Restart the game.


Changes to dbconvert:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - One of the major and important changes since TinyMUX 2.0 is the use of
   CHash in the place of GDBM.  You will notice the changes primarily in the
   way dbconvert and the db_unload and db_load scripts work.

 - dbconvert is the means by which the binary game data is converted to
   flatfile format and back again.  The db_load and db_unload scripts
   simplify the process for the user.

 - The syntax of the scripts is:

   - './db_load netmux netmux.flat netmux.db'

     This converts a flatfile database to binary for use by the server and
     would be done with dbconvert thus:

     ../bin/dbconvert netmux X < netmux.flat > netmux.db

   - './db_unload netmux netmux.db.new netmux.flat'

     This converts binary data to flatfile for would be done with dbconvert
     thus:

     ../bin/dbconvert netmux x < netmux.db.new > netmux.flat
