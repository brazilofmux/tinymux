TinyMUX 2.0: CONFIGURATION
Last Update: April 2000

TinyMUX 2.0 gets the information it needs to operate the game (aside from
the database itself) from a configuration file that is read in at startup.
The configuration file contains various parameters, such as where to find
the database, what port to listen for connects, and many other things.

Modifying mux.config:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This file can be left as is.  However, the prime benefit of customization 
  is in the output of Backup will generate a flatfile that you can easily 
  recognize as belonging to your game(handy, if you run more than one 
  game).
  
  - Open 'mux.config' in your editor and look for the line "GAMENAME".
  
  - Change 'netmux' to something short that you will recognize easily.
  
  - Save your changes and leave the editor. 

Making a New Configuration File:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- In your game directory, the file that you will need to modify is the one 
  called either 'netmux.conf' or 'GAMENAME.conf'.  'netmux' is the default
  GAMENAME and can be changed by editting mux.config(see above).  

- If you choose to change GAMENAME in mux.config, then you will begin by 
  editting the top portion of the file.
  - In the lines marked 'input_database', 'output_database', 
    'crash_database', 'game_dir_file', and 'game_pag_file', change 'netmux'
    to the same thing you entered in GAMENAME.

- If your mail and comsystem databases are named differently from the 
  default, then edit those lines accordingly.

- Change 'port' to the port number your game will be using.

- Change 'mud_name' to what you like.  This can be the formal name of your 
  game.

- Make any other configuration changes you want to make at this time.  They 
  are added individually, one per line to the file.  Common additions to 
  this file would be:

    money_name_singular <text>     The name of one coin (penny)
    money_name_plural <text>       The name of several coins (pennies)
    fork_dump no                   Do this if you have little swap

    paycheck <amount>              Players get this much money each

    postdump_message               Message shown at the end of a DB

- WIZHELP is a wealth of information regarding the more esotric aspects of 
  configuration parameters.  There are many more configuration directives 
  available. Information on individual directives can be obtained with the 
  WIZHELP <directive> command within the mush.


The following is an example configuration file provided by Soruk @AuroraMUSH 
to give you an idea of how yours should look.  Many thanks him for his 
generosity and help with this.  

Note that not all of these configurations are appropriate for all games at 
all times.  please read wizhelp for more information.  It has some comments 
and explanations within it.  Lines preceeded with '#' are ones 'commented 
out' and are not read by the server when it is running.
