TinyMUX 2.12: CONFIGURATION
Last Update: July 2012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TinyMUX 2.12 gets the information it needs to operate the game (aside from
the database itself) from a configuration file that is read in at startup.
The configuration file contains various parameters, such as where to find
the database, what port to listen for connects, and many other things.

Modifying mux.config:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This file can be left as is.  However, the prime benefit of customization
  is in the output of Backup will generate a flatfile that you can easily
  recognize as belonging to your game(handy, if you run more than one
  game).

  - Open 'mux.config' in your editor and look for the line "GAMENAME".

  - Change 'netmux' to something short that you will recognize easily.

  - Save your changes and leave the editor.

Making a New Configuration File:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- In your game directory, the file that you will need to modify is the one
  called either 'netmux.conf' or 'GAMENAME.conf'.  'netmux' is the default
  GAMENAME and can be changed by editing mux.config(see above).

- If you choose to change GAMENAME in mux.config, then you will begin by
  editing the top portion of the file.
  - In the lines marked 'input_database', 'output_database',
    'crash_database', 'game_dir_file', and 'game_pag_file', change 'netmux'
    to the same thing you entered in GAMENAME.

- If your mail and comsystem databases are named differently from the
  default, then edit those lines accordingly.

- Change 'port' to the port number your game will be using.

- Change 'mud_name' to what you like.  This can be the formal name of your
  game.

- Make any other configuration changes you want to make at this time.  They
  are added individually, one per line to the file.  Common additions to
  this file would be:

    money_name_singular <text>     The name of one coin (penny)
    money_name_plural <text>       The name of several coins (pennies)
    fork_dump no                   Do this if you have little swap

                                   money.

                                   1 in <chance> chance of finding a

    postdump_message               Message shown at the end of a DB

                                   been idle more than the specified
                                   timeout.

- WIZHELP is a wealth of information regarding the more esoteric aspects of
  configuration parameters.  There are many more configuration directives
  available. Information on individual directives can be obtained with the
  WIZHELP <directive> command within the mush.


The following is an example configuration file provided by Soruk @AuroraMUSH
to give you an idea of how yours should look.  Many thanks him for his
generosity and help with this.

Note that not all of these configurations are appropriate for all games at
all times.  please read wizhelp for more information.  It has some comments
and explanations within it.  Lines preceded with '#' are ones 'commented
out' and are not read by the server when it is running.
