TinyMUX 2.0: CREDITS
Last Update: February 2001

TinyMUX 2.0 is derived from TinyMUX 1.6. It is maintained by Stephen Dennis
(Brazil@BrazilMUX) and would not exist without the generous contributions of
many individuals. Ideas for features, occasionally code, documentation,
project support, bug hunting, came from many places, including TinyMUSH,
ChaoticMUX, RhostMUSH, and PennMUSH.

We would like to thank the following people:
 
- Barbarella@Pacifica for making it fun, for proving to me that MU'ing is a
  Good Thing (tm), for pulling me into hosting and server work. Without the
  choices she made, MUX 2.0 would never have happened.
  
- David Passmore for his long time care and maintenance of TinyMUX.
 
- Andrew Molitor, for the radix compression library, and some wonderful
  utilities.

- Soruk from AuroraMUSH for his long time contributions toward making 
  and keeping TinyMUX Linux compatible, as well as the sample config file   
  found in CONFIGURATION.

- T. Alexander Popiel for help with conceptual issues in general and 
  specifically with the parser.

- Steven Legowik (BEM@Erisian.net) for Makefile, cross-platform work, and
  modifications to Backup.

- Virginia Legowik (Audumla) and Lilith@Sandbox for committed readme and 
  helpfile work. For infrastructure support with web sites and mailing 
  lists.  For making a team.

- Ashen-Shugar and RhostMUSH for their bug reports and support.

- Robby Griffyn and ChaoticMUX for bug reports.

- Lew Newby (Dragon) for his stress-testing, cross-platform builds, and 
  bug reports.

- MacGuvyer @ Pacifica for a Unix patch for WoD-realms which led to 
  porting all of MUX 2.0 back to Unix.

- Nick Gammon for the initial prototype of NT IO Completion ports.

- Judge Dredd@Pacifica for specification of WOD_REALMS.

  along the way:
