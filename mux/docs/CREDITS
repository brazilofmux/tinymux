TinyMUX 2.12: CREDITS
Last Update: July 2012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TinyMUX 2.12 is maintained by Stephen Dennis (Brazil@BrazilMUX) and would not
exist without the generous contributions of many individuals.  Ideas for
features, occasionally code, documentation, project support, bug hunting,
came from many places, including TinyMUSH, ChaoticMUX, RhostMUSH, and
PennMUSH.

We would like to thank the following people:

- Barbarella@Pacifica for making it fun, for proving to me that MU'ing is a
  Good Thing (tm), for pulling me into hosting and server work.  Without the
  choices she made, TinyMUX 2.0 would never have happened.

- David Passmore for his long time care and maintenance of TinyMUX.

- Andrew Molitor, for the radix compression library, and some wonderful
  utilities.

- Soruk from AuroraMUSH for his long time contributions toward making
  and keeping TinyMUX Linux compatible, as well as the sample config file
  found in CONFIGURATION.

- T. Alexander Popiel for help with conceptual issues in general and
  specifically with the parser.

- Steven Legowik (BEM@Erisian.net) for Makefile, cross-platform work, and
  modifications to Backup.

- Virginia Legowik (Audumla) and Lilith@Sandbox for README work, initial web
  site, mailing lists, gathering the right people, asking the right questions,
  and making it possible.

- Ashen-Shugar and RhostMUSH for their bug reports and support.

- Robby Griffin (Alierak) and ChaoticMUX for bug reports.

- Lew Newby (Dragon) for his stress-testing, cross-platform builds, and bug
  reports.

- MacGuvyer@Pacifica for a Unix patch for WoD-realms which led to porting all
  of TinyMUX 2.0 back to Unix.

- Nick Gammon for the initial prototype of NT IO Completion ports.

- Judge Dredd@Pacifica for specification of WOD_REALMS.

- nails of mushpark for hosting the TinyMUX website, tarballs, and wiki.
