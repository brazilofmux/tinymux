Release Information:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Server development for TinyMUX is done by the scheme as listed below.
These numbers will be reflected by the result of typing 'VERSION' on
the game

2.x.x       Major or potentially major change in project direction such as a
            new primary maintainer.  For example, David Passmore was
            responsible for the 1.x series, and Stephen Dennis is responsible
            for the 2.x series.

2.1.x       A single release cycle of a set of features.  Typically, there is
            one every year and the version number corresponds to the year in
            which the development occurred.  For example,

                  Years       Version
                1998-2000       2.0
                   2001         2.1
                   2002         2.2
                   2003         2.3
                   2004         2.4
                2005-2006       2.6
                   2007         2.7
                2008-2009       2.9
                2010-2011       2.10
                   2012         2.12

2.x.1       Feature Change.  After Beta has started, the third number
            indicates a change in the feature set -- usually the addition of
            features, but it could also be the removal of a feature.  During
            development, the third number is zero (0).

2.x.x.x     Bug release, build number, or patch to an existing release.  These
            will be released as needed to fix bugs in a format useable to the
            'applypatch', 'patch', and 'dopatch' utilities.


Typically, development for each release cycle begins in January.  After twelve
months, it will usually enter a beta period and stay there for three or four
more months before being released.  Typically, after a year or two, a release
is obsoleted by a later cycle.  So, usually, there are two or three release
cycles being developed and supported at the same time.

Every release cycle consists of an uninterrupted series of patches through
development, beta, release until obsolescence.
