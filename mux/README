TinyMUX 2.2:  README (Unix-based)
Last Update:  June 2002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Congratulations and welcome to the README file for TinyMUX 2.2.  That 
you have chosen to actually read the file is a sign of bravery equal to 
that of Beowulf facing Grendel or anyone who has ever faced the garden
variety lumbering behemoth.  

We know that README files are often turgid and vague, filled with 
technobabble that ties the reader up needlessly in corundums of little 
purpose.  Too often, the story  ends with someone spending a lot of time 
with someone else in countless hours of consultation, all to type a few 
lines that were there the whole time, buried beyond view.
  
In the past, this has resulted in README being tossed aside, unread, 
unwanted, unloved, and probably bitter from the experience.  However, 
because we want you to succeed, we are happy to provide a file that will, 
in our sincerest hopes, provide you with enough information to make that 
possible.  If not, it should be at least an entertaining read....

The TinyMUX 2.2 README and supplemental documentation has been divided into 
multiple files.  For discussion and instructions on how to do various 
things associated with the care and feeding of your MUX, please refer to 
the following files:

General Information:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TinyMUX 2.2 is currently being developed in parallel under Win32 and SuSE 7.3
and is written in C and C++.  It is a continuation of the TinyMUX 1.x line of
servers.

The latest version of this code can generally be found running at:

  svdltd.com 6250 

Refer to the file CHANGES for information about new features, commands, 
and bug fixes.  NOTES now contains a LOT of small bits of info related 
to running the server, as well as reminders about how to flatfile the 
database for conversions and moving from site to site.

Reminder of changes to dbconvert from MUX 1.x:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - One of the major and important changes from MUX 1.x is the use of CHash
   in the place of GDBM.  You will notice the changes primarily in the way 
   dbconvert and the db_unload and db_load scripts work.  
 
 - dbconvert is the means by which the binary game data is converted to 
   flatfile format and back again.  The db_load and db_unload scripts 
   simplify the process for the user. 
 
 - The syntax of the scripts is:
   
   - './db_load netmux netmux.flat netmux.db'
     
     This converts flatfiled database to binary for use by the server and 
     would be done with dbconvert thus:
     
     ../bin/dbconvert netmux X < netmux.flat > netmux.db
   
   - './db_unload netmux netmux.db.new netmux.flat'
     
     This converts binary data to flatfile for would be done with dbconvert 
     thus:
     
     ../bin/dbconvert netmux x < netmux.db.new > netmux.flat


Conversions from Other Database Formats:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Support for other database formats has been removed from MUX 2.2. To import
one of the following formats, you must first use dbconvert from TinyMUX 2.0
before using the resulting flatfile with MUX 2.2.

   TinyMUX 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 (not beta)
   TinyMUX(Win32Beta) 1.5, 1.6, 2.0
   TinyMUSH 2.0 (all versions)
   TinyMUSH 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 release version (not beta)
   TinyMUSH 2.2.4U1 release version (not beta)

BUGS! and bug reporting:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First things first....  Bugs happen in any large and complex piece of 
code.  The important thing to understand is that the dev team has worked 
very hard to ferret out and fix as many of the crashing/corrupting bugs 
in the server as possible.  As part of the process, we also fixed a lot 
of the legacy bugs from MUX 1.6 and before.  We intend to keep doing it.

As you might expect, the complexion of the bug finds has changed over the
years. We are finding much fewer crashing/corrupting bugs than before,
and at the same time, the bugs we find are now more likely to be our own
than legacy issues.

As for the cases where you do find bugs, we would like you to take the 
time to send an email with as much data as possible about the bug.  Each 
bug report we receive will be assigned a number from 1 to 4 according to
severity (how much pain it causes) and prioritized from 1 to 3 according to
how beneficial it would be to fix it relative to other bugs on the list.

-- Please double check to be sure it really is a bug and not a new 
   feature or design decision.  This is important to the process, as it  
   may mean that something was missed in the documentation and needs to 
   be made clearer.  This simple test is that if the server crashes, 
   it's a bug and if you can't tell, consider it one.

-- Try to reproduce and document the sequence of events that will 
   demonstrate the bug.  This will help the dev team identify the problem 
   sooner.  The 'log' configuration parameter may be very helpful in this
   process.

-- Send mail about it to: sdennis@svdltd.com
   If the bug crashes the mux, try to include the following information 
   from running dbx (or gdb) on the resulting core file:
     - Output of the 'where' command.
     - Output of the 'dump' command for each procedure level.

-- To use gdb or dbx, make sure you are in the game/ directory, and type

        gdb bin/netmux core     OR      dbx bin/netmux core

-- From there, simply type 'help' for help, or 'quit' to exit.

Environment:
~~~~~~~~~~~
TinyMUX 2.2 should run on most Unixes with BSD-style sockets and a C++ 
compiler that groks function prototypes. It is 64-bit 'clean' code.  It 
has been compiled and run successfully 'out of the box' on the following 
platforms:

RedHat 5.1, 5.2, 6.0
Slackware 3.6, 4.0, 7.0
Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
Mandrake 6.0, 7.0
Linux Kernels 2.0.35 - 2.2.14
IRIX (Some versions)
Debian 2.1, 2.2
FreeBSD
OpenBSD
SuSE 6.2
AIX 4.3
Mac OS X.

In fact, the only platform that we know won't work is HP-UX.

If you get TinyMUX 2.2 working on another platform, please let us know
about it!
