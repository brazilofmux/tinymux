.SH NAME
tinymux \- The TinyMUX mush server
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B tinymux
mush server.
It was written for the Debian distribution because the original program
does not have a manual page.
.PP
This is the
.B TinyMUX
flavor of mud servers of the MUSH branch. It provides a number of
robust features to enable players to extend the virtual world. This
is done by building new rooms and objects, and utilizing its internal
programming language, MUSHcode.
.PP
.B TinyMUX
does not provide a superset of all the features available in other MUSH
flavors, but those it does implement provide a stable and robust
environment that performs as well as or better than that of its peers.
.SH CREDITS
TinyMUX 2.12 is derived from TinyMUX 1.6. It is maintained by Stephen Dennis
(Brazil@BrazilMUX) and would not exist without the generous contributions of
many individuals. Ideas for features, occasionally code, documentation,
project support, bug hunting, came from many places, including TinyMUSH,
ChaoticMUX, RhostMUSH, and PennMUSH.
.PP
We would like to thank the following people:
.HP
\- Barbarella@Pacifica for making it fun, for proving to me that MU'ing is a
Good Thing (tm), for pulling me into hosting and server work. Without the
choices she made, MUX 2.0 would never have happened.
.HP
\- David Passmore for his long time care and maintenance of TinyMUX.
.HP
\- Andrew Molitor, for the radix compression library, and some wonderful
utilities.
.HP
\- Soruk from AuroraMUSH for his long time contributions toward making and
keeping TinyMUX Linux compatible, as well as the sample config file found in
CONFIGURATION.
.HP
\- T. Alexander Popiel for help with conceptual issues in general and
specifically with the parser.
.HP
\- Steven Legowik (BEM@Erisian.net) for Makefile, cross-platform work, and
modifications to Backup.
.HP
\- Virginia Legowik (Audumla) and Lilith@Sandbox for committed readme and
helpfile work. For infrastructure support with web sites and mailing lists.
For making a team.
.HP
\- Ashen\-Shugar and RhostMUSH for their bug reports and support.
.HP
\- Robby Griffyn and ChaoticMUX for bug reports.
.HP
\- Lew Newby (Dragon) for his stress-testing, cross-platform builds, and bug
reports.
.HP
\- MacGuvyer @ Pacifica for a Unix patch for WoD-realms which led to porting
all of MUX 2.0 back to Unix.
.HP
\- Nick Gammon for the initial prototype of NT IO Completion ports.
.HP
\- Judge Dredd@Pacifica for specification of WOD_REALMS.
.HP
