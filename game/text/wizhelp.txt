& topics
  Help available on the following Topics:
 
  CAUTIONS           CONFIG PARAMETERS  DEBUG FEATURES     FILES
  FLAGS              INHERITANCE        LOGGING            MASTER ROOM
  PERMISSIONS        SEARCH CRITERIA    SITE LISTS

& flags
  Information is available on the following flags:
 
  INHERIT(i)         MARKED(m)          STARTUP(z)         SUSPECT(u)
  WIZARD(W)

& examine
  Command: examine[/<switches>] [<object>]
 
  Wizards may use the /debug switch to see additional information about the
  object.  The Owner, Exits, Next, and Contents fields of the object are
  shown in numeric form only, and an attribute list is included.

& give
  Command: give[/<switches>] <who> = <what>
 
  Wizards may use the /quiet switch to suppress the 'You give X to P' and
  'P gave you X' messages.  Other messages related to giving objects
  (such as the xDROP and XSUCC attributes on the object being given, or
  error messages) are not suppressed.

& SESSION
  Command: SESSION <prefix>
  The SESSION command displays character input and output information for
  all connected players, or just those who match <prefix>.
 
  This command can be used to help identify network problems as follows:
    - A nonzero Input Pending count can indicate indicate typeahead or a
      client program dumping commands faster than the command scheduling
      parameters let them be executed.  Telnet sessions in character mode also
      show up with positive Input Pending counts when the player is in the
      middle of typing a command.
    - A nozero Input Lost count means that the player has typed a line longer
      than what the MUX can handle.  This usually indicates a problem with
      the player's client or terminal (a stuck key).
    - A persistently large Output Pending count can indicate netlag between
      the host site and the player's site, or merely that the player has
      performed a command that generated a lot of output which hasn't been
      sent yet.
    - A nonzero Output Lost count usually means that the player performed
      a command that produced more output than the output buffer could hold.
      It may also indicate network problems or that the player is generating
      output faster than the network or his client can process it.
     
& slay
  Command: slay <player/object>
  Kills the indicated player or object without paying any insurance to the
  victim.  It should be used in places where suicide should not be rewarded.
  See also: kill, IMMORTAL.

& WHO
  Command: WHO <prefix>
 
  The WHO command returns miscellaneous information about connected players.
  It returns the player name, connect time, idle time, and player flags just
  like the player WHO command (which is available as the DOING command), but
  returns the following information in place of the player's Doing string:
 
     Room         - The room that the player is in.
     Commands     - The number of commands that the player has entered during
                    this session (not counting machine commands).
     Host flags   - located bwtween the Commands and Host fields:
                    F(forbidden), R(registration), +(suspect).
     Host         - The Internet host name or address from where the player has
                    connected.

  See also: SESSION, DOING.

& DOING
  Command: DOING <prefix>

  This command is very similar to the mortal WHO command (the wizard WHO
  command returns different information).  When run by a wizard, the DOING
  command reports additional information about the player in the form of flag
  letters between the idle time and the players' Doing string.  The following
  letters may be present:
 
  D - Player is set DARK.
  d - Player is not shown on the WHO list because they have been idle for
      longer than the default inactivity timeout and the idle_dark_wiz
      configuration parameter has been turned on. (only if not D)
  U - Player is set UNFINDABLE.
  u - Player is in an UNFINDABLE location (only if not U).
  + - Player is set SUSPECT.
 
  See also: SESSION, WHO, DARK, UNFINDABLE, SUSPECT, idle_dark_wiz.

& wizhelp
  Command: wizhelp <topic>
  Displays information from the wizard help file.  The information is
  typically of use only to wizards and/or the game maintainer.
  See also: the source code.

& @addcommand
  Command: @addcommand <name>=<thing>/<attribute>
  This command has the capability of adding a softcoded command to the MUX's
  built-in command table. If <name> already exists as a built-in command,
  such as 'look' or 'WHO', it will actually replace the functionality of
  that command, and all aliases that currently point to it. As in look's
  case, the aliases 'l', 'lo', and 'loo', and the main command 'look' will
  all point to these softcoded commands. The syntax of <thing>/<attribute> is
  like any normal $command. 
 
  For example:

  > &LOOK me=$look:say I looked here!
  > &LOOK_WITH_ARG me=$look *:say I looked at %0!
  > &LOOK_OUTSIDE me=$look/outside *:say I looked outside at %0!
  > @addcommand look=me/look
  > @addcommand look=me/look_with_arg
  > @addcommand look=me/look_outside
 
  { 'help @addcommand2' for more }
 
& @addcommand2
  Yes, you can specify more than one attribute to go with <name>. When you
  type 'look' or 'look sofa', the game will execute all attributes that
  match what you have typed in. Aliases like 'l' are expanded to 'look' so
  you don't have to worry about those when you take command matching into
  consideration. If none of the attributes attached match (the attribute
  *must* begin with $<name> in order to match at all!), no output will
  be generated.
 
  Another use is to speed up use of a particular global command. Just use
  @addcommand to add it to the built-in list, and it will be looked up
  much faster.
 
  See also: @delcommand, @listcommands.
 
& @delcommand
  Command: @delcommand <name>[=<thing>/<attribute>]
  Deletes a command added by @addcommand. With only <name> specified, deletes
  all added commands under <name>. When you specify <thing> and <attribute>,
  it only deletes that specific entry. If the command or commands you are
  deleting had replaced a built-in command, the built-in command and all
  aliases are restored to their normal names and actions.
 
  See also: @addcommand, @listcommands.
 
& @listcommands
  Command: @listcommands [<name>]
  Lists commands added by @addcommand. With <name> specified, lists all
  commands added under that particular command name. Without it, lists all
  added commands.
 
  See also: @addcommand, @listcommands.
 
& @admin
  Command: @admin <param>=<value>
  Sets a TinyMUX configuration parameter to the indicated value.
  Type 'wizhelp config parameters' for a list of the config parameters that
  may be set.

& @apply_marked
  Command: @apply_marked <command>
  Performs <command> once for each object in the database that has its MARK
  flag set, substituting the characters ## for the object number of the
  marked object.  The command is performed by the player invoking the
  @apply_marked command, not by the marked object.  This command may only
  be used when database cleaning is disabled (via @disable cleaning),
  as cleaning uses the MARKED flag to check connectivity.
  See also: @mark, @mark_all, MARKED.

& @attribute
  Command: @attribute[/<switch>] <attrib>[=<value>]
  Performs operations on user-named attributes depending on the switch used.
  The following switches are available:
     /access   - Changes the access to the named attribute.  <value> is a
                 space-separated list of permissions to add or remove from
                 the attribute's access permissions.
     /delete   - Removes the named attribute from the attribute table.
                 This switch does not remove instances of the attribute from
                 objects, and any that remain will be renamed to the 
                 user-named attribute that re-uses the attribute number
                 of the deleted attribute.
     /rename   - Changes the name of the named attribute to <value>.
  Note that changes to user-named attributes performed by this command
  are permanent and do not need to be performed each time the MUX is
  restarted.
 
& @BOOT
@BOOT

  COMMAND: @boot[/quiet] <player>
           @boot/port <port#>

  Severs the named player's connection to the game.  The player is given a
  notice that they have been booted.  If the player is connected to the game
  more than once, then all connections to that player are severed.

  The following switches are available:

    /quiet - Don't give the booted player any special notice.

    /port  - Disconnects only a specific port.  In this case, <port#> must
             be the port number obtained from the SESSION command.

  See also: @destroy, @toad, SESSION.

& @chown
  Command: @chown <object>=<player>
 
  Wizards may @chown objects, rooms, and exits to other players.
  @Chowned objects are set HALT.
 
  See also: @chownall.

& @clone
  Command: @clone[/<switches>] <object>
  Wizards may also specify the /preserve switch, which preserves the original
  owner of the object in the new copy, instead of creating the copy as being
  owned by the wizard.

& @chownall
  Command: @chownall <victim>[=<recipient>]
  Changes the ownership of all of the victim's objects, rooms, and exits to
  the indicated recipient (or to the wizard performing the @chownall if
  no recipient is specified).  All objects, rooms, and exits are set HALTED.
  See also: @chown.

& @cut
  Command: @cut <object/exit>
  Cuts off the object or exit list for the current location at the indicated
  object or exit by setting [next(thing)] to NOTHING.  Objects or exits that
  follow in the chain are not moved or otherwise changed, and are only
  accessable by object number.  This command is intended for performing
  database repair, and should be used only with extreme caution.

& @dbck
  Command: @dbck
  Performs a scan of the database looking for inconsistencies in the object
  chains, disconnected rooms, rooms waiting to be destroyed, and problems in
  the object free list.  Problems that are found are reported to the log
  file, disconnected rooms are reported to their owners, and players are
  credited for rooms destroyed.  Database checks are automatically run
  periodically, so there is usually no need to use this command.
  See also: @admin, @disable, @enable, @list.

& @dbclean
  Command: @dbclean
  This command searches the entire database and removes any stale
  user-defined attributes. It should be used sparingly, as it may take many
  minutes to execute, depending upon database size and machine speed. Only
  God may execute this command.
 
& @destroy
  Command: @destroy[/<switches>] <object>
  Players are always considered SAFE.  Objects owned by other players are
  not otherwise treated specially.

& @disable
  Command: @disable <option>
  Turns off the indicated MUX runtime parameter.  The following parameters
  may be turned off:
    building      - Allows players to use the building commands.
    checkpointing - Enables periodic database checkpoint dumping.
    cleaning      - Enables periodic scanning of the database for rooms
                    to be destroyed.
    dequeueing    - Allows commands to be removed from the queue and
                    executed.
    idlechecking  - Enables periodic checking for and booting of idle
                    players.
    interpret     - Enables execution of commands that place commands
                    on the queue.
    logins        - Allows nonwizard players to connect to their characters.
    eventchecking - Enables certain attribute events (@daily, etc) to occur.
 
  These parameters are all enabled by default.
  See also: @enable, @list.

& @doing
  Command: @doing[/<switch>] <text>
  Wizards may use the /header switch to set the Doing header in the WHO report.
  If no header is specified, the header is reset to "Doing".

& @dump
  Command: @dump[/<switches>]

  Writes a checkpoint dump of the database to disk.  Checkpoint dumps are
  automatically performed periodically, so there is usually no need to use
  this command.  Switches may be used to either dump just the structure
  or text portions of the database to disk.  The default is to write out
  both the text and structure portions.

  All of the following switches may by used individually or together:

     flatfile   - Dump an internally consistent flatfile which together
                  with the mail and comsystem databases represent the
                  entire database of game -- useful in a variety of ways
                  including for a backup and for moving from one host to
                  another.
     structure  - Dump the structure portion of the database to a linear
                  human-readable file.
     text       - Ensure that all changes to the text portion of the
                  database are written out to disk.
 
  Note that the above structure and text options will cause your database and
  certain caches to be out of sync. They should NOT be used in the course
  of normal operation.
 
  See also: @admin, @disable, @enable, @list, @shutdown.

& @enable
  Command: @enable <option>
  Turns on the indicated MUX runtime parameter.  The following parameters
  may be turned on:
    building      - Allows players to use the building commands.
    checkpointing - Enables periodic database checkpoint dumping.
    cleaning      - Enables periodic scanning of the database for rooms
                    to be destroyed.
    dequeueing    - Allows commands to be removed from the queue and
                    executed.
    idlechecking  - Enables periodic checking for and booting of idle
                    players.
    interpret     - Enables execution of commands that place commands
                    on the queue.
    logins        - Allows nonwizard players to connect to their characters.
    eventchecking - Enables certain attribute events (@daily, etc) to occur.
 
  These parameters are all enabled by default.
  See also: @disable, @list.

& @fixdb
  Command: @fixdb[/<switch>] <object>=<value>
  This command directly edits the database structure according to the
  switch specified.  As such, it is possible to produce database
  inconsistencies that can hang or crash the server.  This command should
  be used with extreme caution.
 
  The following switches are available:
     contents     - Sets the contents pointer of <object> to <value>
     exits        - Sets the exits pointer of <object> to <value>
     location     - Sets the location pointer of <object> to <value>
     next         - Sets the next pointer of <object> to <value>
     owner        - Sets the owner of <object> to <value>
     pennies      - Sets the value or wealth of <object> to <value>
     rename       - Renames <object> to <value>

& @function
  Command: @function[/<switches>] <function>=<object>/<attr>

  This command displays a list of currently-defined global functions or
  adds a new global function named <function>.  When invoked, the
  arguments to the function are loaded into %0-%9, the <attr> attribute
  from <object> is fetched, and substitution is performed on the
  resulting text.  The result of that substitution is returned as the
  function result.

  If no arguments are given, or if the /list switch is given, the command
  displays a list of the currently-defined global functions. /privileged
  functions are indicated with a 'W' and /preserve functions are indicated
  with a 'p'.

  If the /privileged switch is given, then the new global function is
  evaluated as if the evaluation were being performed by the object on
  which it is stored, instead of as if it were being performed by the
  invoker of the function.  This may be used to allow access to
  information normally available only to wizards.
 
  The /preserve switch causes r-registers to be preserved across the
  defined function, so you can feel free to use registers in the code
  without worrying about them overwriting previous definitions.
 
  The function definitions created by @function are not stored in the
  database so they need to be re-created each time the MUX is started.
  It is recommended that the Startup attribute for player #1 include
  code to set up all global functions.
 
  Function definitions may not be removed (aside from shutting down and
  restarting the MUX, but they may be redefined so that they point to
  an unused attribute.  This command may normally only be invoked by
  player #1.
 
& @halt
  Command: @halt[/<switches>] [<object>]
  This command can be used to halt commands being run by a specific object,
  all commands being run by objects owned by a specific player, or all
  commands in the game.  If <object> is not specified, the object running
  the command is halted.  If the object being halted is a player, then
  all commands being run by objects owned by that player are halted.
  Halting an object does not affect commands waiting on it as a semaphore,
  use the @drain command to reset a semaphore.
 
  The /all switch may be used to halt all commands globally.
  See also: @drain, @notify, kill, HALTED, SEMAPHORES.

& @kick
  Command: @kick <count>
  Immediately executes the first <count> commands from the top of the queue.
  See also: @disable, @enable, @timewarp.

& @list
  Command: @list [<option>]
  Lists information from internal databases.  Information is available
  about the following options:
 
    allocations         attr_permissions    attributes          bad_names
    buffers             commands            costs               db_stats
    default_flags       flags               functions           globals
    hashstats           logging             options             permissions
    powers              process             site_info           switches
    user_attributes
 
  Type wizhelp @list <option> for help with a particular option.

& @list allocations
  Command: @list allocations
  This command lists the usage statistics for the internal buffer pools.
  For each buffer pool, the following information is listed:
    Size   - The size of a buffer, in characters.
    InUse  - The number of buffers presently allocated from the pool.
    Total  - The total number of buffers currently in the pool.
    Allocs - The total number of buffers ever allocated from the pool.
    Lost   - The number of buffers lost due to buffer header corruption.
 
  Information is reported for the following pools:
    Lbufs    - Large buffers, used when handling data input by the user,
               object attributes, the results of interpreting commands, and
               many other places.
    Mbufs    - Medium-sized buffers, for when an sbuf is too small but an lbuf
               is too large.
    Sbufs    - Small buffers, for when you need only a little space.
    Bools    - Boolean expressions, used when evaluating locks.
    Descs    - Network descriptors, one is used for each connected player.
    Qentries - Queue entries, one is used for each command placed on the
               queue. (@wait, @trigger, @switch, @dolist, etc).
 
  See also: @list buffers.

& @list attr_permissions
  Command: @list attr_permissions
  Lists the attributes and the access restrictions that have been placed on
  them. The attributes are listed one per line.  Refer to the attr_access
  config parameter for the meanings of the restrictions.
 
  Note that being allowed to write to an attribute does not imply the right
  to use the @<attr-name> shorthand command to set it, just the @set command.
  See also: @list permissions, attr_access.

& @list attributes
  Command: @list attributes
  Lists the attributes that are visible or settable by you.
  See also: @list attr_access, @list permissions.

& @list bad_names
  Command: @list bad_names
  This command lists the player names that are not allowed to be created.
  Any create request (whether via the login screen or @pcreate) that matches
  (after wildcard expansion) one of the names in the list will be rejected.

& @list buffers
  Command: @list buffers
  For each buffer in a buffer pool that is currently allocated, lists where
  within TinyMUX the buffer was allocated.

& @list commands
  Command: @list commands
  Lists the internal commands that you may execute.  This command does not
  list the attribute-setting commands that you may use (like @va or @ahear),
  and does not list exits in your current room or $-commands on objects.
  See also: @list attr_access, @list attributes, @list permissions.

& @list costs
  Command: @list costs
  Lists the costs that are associated with some commands, particularly those
  that expand the database.

    dequeueing    - Indicates whether or not commands on the queue may be
                    automatically executed.
    idlechecking  - Indicates whether or not the inactivity limits are
                    enforced.

                               from this site.
 
  See also: forbid_site, permit_site, register_site, suspect_site, trust_site.

& @list switches
  Command: @list switches
  Lists the commands that support switches as well as the switches that may
  be used.

& @list user_attributes
  Command: @list user_attributes
  Lists the defined user-named attributes, along with their internal
  attribute numbers and access restrictions.

& @list_file
  Command: @list_file <file>
  Lists the contents of one of the message files that are shown during the
  connect/create/disconnect process as conditions warrant.  The following
  files may be listed:
     badsite_connect - shown when a connection is opened from a forbidden
                       site.
     connect          - shown when a connection is opened from a site for
                        which registration is not enforced.
     create_register  - shown when the 'create' command is used from a site 
                        for which registration is enforced.
     down             - shown when a non-wizard attempts to connect to or
                        create a character when logins are disabled.
     full             - shown when a non-wizard attempts to connect to or
                        create a character when the maximum number of connected
                        players are connected.  Note that this is different
                        from what happens when someone tries to connect but
                        there are no free descriptors, which is
                        machine-dependent (usually the connect attempt hangs
                        or is rejected).
     guest_motd       - shown to guest characters immediately after they
                        connect.
{ 'wizhelp @list_file2' for more }
& @list_file2
     motd             - shown to all players immediately after they connect.
                        (except guests and players connecting for the first
                        time)
     newuser          - shown to players the first time they connect in place
                        of the motd file.
     quit             - shown to players when they disconnect from the game.
     register_connect - shown when a connection is opened from a site for
                        which registration is enforced.
     wizard_motd      - shown to wizards when they connect in addition to
                        the motd file.
  See also: @readcache, badsite_file, connect_file, connect_reg_file,
            down_file, guest_file, motd_file, newuser_file, quit_file,
            register_create_file, wizard_motd_file.

& @listmotd
  Command: @listmotd
  Lists the current MOTD messages as set by the @motd command.
  See also: @motd.

& @lock
  Command: @lock <object>=<key>
  Note that with attribute locking, a WIZARD object can read any attribute of
  any object, including attributes invisible to players.
 
  Player #1 may also make attribute locks of the form <attr-num>:<value>
  Note that if <attr-num> is not a valid attribute number, the lock will
  never succeed.

& @log
  Command: @log <file>=<message>
  This logs the message (without timestamp) to the named file. Pathnames
  are stripped, and the file resides in mux2.0/game/logs/
 
  The file must already exist for the @log request to succeed, and can only
  be created at the MUX account shell.

& @mark
  Command: @mark[/<switches>] [<player>] [<class>=<restriction>]
  Sets or clears the MARKED flags for objects that match the search criteria.
  This command may only be used when database cleaning is disabled (via
  @disable cleaning), as cleaning uses the MARKED flag to check
  connectivity.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /set    - (default) Set the MARKED flag on the selected objects.
     /clear  - Clear the MARKED flag on the selected objects.
 
  See also: @apply_marked, @mark_all, MARKED, SEARCH CRITERIA.

& @mark_all
  Command: @mark_all[/<switches>]
 
  Sets or clears the MARKED flag for all objects in the database.  This command
  may only be used when database cleaning is disabled (via @disable cleaning),
  as cleaning uses the MARKED flag to check connectivity.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /set    - (default) Set the MARKED flag on all objects.
     /clear  - Clear the MARKED flag on all objects.
 
  See also: @apply_marked, @mark_all, MARKED.

& @motd
  Command: @motd[/<switches>] <message>
 
  This command sets or lists short messages that are displayed to players
  after they successfully log in to the game (or after they fail because
  logins are not allowed).  These messages are displayed in addition to
  the contents of the motd.txt and wizmotd.txt files.
 
  The following switches are available:
     (No switches)   - Sets the message that all players see when they connect.
     /wizard         - Sets the message that wizards see when they connect.
     /down           - Sets the message the players see when they try to
                       connect, but fail because logins are disabled.
     /full           - Sets the message that players see when they try to
                       connect, but fail because there are too many players
                       already connected.
     /list           - Lists the current messages.
  See also: @listmotd.

& @newpassword
  Command: @newpassword <player>[=<newpassword>]
  Gives <player> the new password <newpassword>.  If <newpassword> is not
  specified, the player is given a null password.  If logged in, the player
  is notified that his password has been changed.
  See also: @password.

& @pcreate
  Command: @pcreate <player>=<password>
  Creates a new player with the indicated password.  This command is
  equivalent to typing 'create <player> <password>' from the connection
  screen, and is normally only used when registration is enabled.
  See also: REGISTRATION.

& @poor
  Command: @poor <amount>
  Sets the wealth of all players to <amount>.

& @ps
  Command: @ps[/<switches>] [<object>]
  Wizards may also use the /all switch to view the entire queue.
  See also: @ps (player version).

& @quota
  Command: @quota[/<switches>] [<player>[=<quota>]]
           @quota/all[/<switches>] [<quota>]]
  Lists or sets the player's (or everyone's) remaining or total quota
  according to the switches used.
  The following switches are available:
     /all       - Display or set the quota for all players.
     /fix       - Repair the remaining or total quota, assuming that the other
                  is correct.
     /remaining - Set or repair the remaining quota.
     /set       - Set the remaining or total quota to the specified value.
     /total     - Set or repair the total quota.
  See also: QUOTAS.

& @readcache
  Command: @readcache
  Reads the commonly-used text files and help indexes on the game directory
  into an internal cache, destroying the prior contents of the cache.
  Use this command whenever you change one of the text of index files in
  the game directory. Be sure and run mkindx to produce new index files
  before you run this command.

& @restart
  Command: @restart
  This command literally restarts the game. To the players, it appears as
  merely a short pause in the action. There are many reasons to @restart,
  including updating the source code, freeing built-up memory, etc.
  @restart dumps and reloads the database, so you cannot use it to change the
  database. You may recompile and use @restart to implement the changes
  without having to @shutdown.
 
  @restart maintains all connections, any relevant information about them
  across restarts. Nothing should be adversely affected by an @restart.
  However, it should be used sparingly due to the tedious nature of dumping
  and loading the database.
 
  NOTE: If you update the MUX binary with an outside binary, you should
  never overwrite the old one. Instead, you should delete or move it, and
  place the new binary in its place, for reasons beyond the scope of this
  document. This warning does not apply if you remake the binary in your
  game's source directory.
 
  Sending the MUX process a SIGUSR1 will duplicate an @restart.
 
& @shutdown
  Command: @shutdown <text>
  Disconnects all connected players, saves the database to disk, and shuts
  down the game.  The game is unavailable until it is restarted.  If an
  argument is specified, it is written to the file named by the status_file
  config directive.
  See also: status_file

& @startslave
  Command: @startslave
  This command restarts the slave process that does user and hostname
  lookups. It should only be used it the slave process has locked up or died
  for some reason.
 
& @timewarp
  Command: @timewarp[/<switches>] <secs>
  Subtracts (or adds if negative) <secs> to one or more internal timers,
  depending on the switches specified from the following list:
     /check    - The time left until the next consistency check and database
                 cleaning.
     /dump     - The time left until the next automatic checkpoint dump.
     /idle     - The time left until the next check for idle users.
     /queue    - (default) Adjusts the time-to-execute for all entries in the
                 wait and semaphore queues.  Entries whose time-to-execute
                 becomes less than the current time are then ready for
                 execution. The contents of the object queue are also
                 appended to the player queue.
 
  Note: these flags may be specified together if desired.
  See also: @list options.

& @timecheck
  Command: @timecheck[/<switches>]
 
  An accounting of how much total CPU time has been used to execute commands
  on each object.
  
  Win9x caveat:  Win9x does not provide a number of how much CPU time the
  MUX game server has consumed and so instead of CPU time, we use a
  high-resolution elapsed time instead. For some CPUs, the resolution of
  this clock can be as high as the processor itself, but as useful as this
  is, this accounting does not make a distinction between time spent in the
  server and time spent in another unrelated application.

  The command takes the following switches:
 
    /screen     Print information to the screen.
    /log        Print information to the logfile.
    /reset      Clear the counters.
 
  If no switches are provided, printing to the screen and clearing the
  counters are assumed. The counters are otherwise not cleared unless
  /reset is specified.
 
& @toad
  Command: @toad[/<switches>] <victim>[=<recipient>]
  Turns the victim into an object (a slimy toad) and disconnects them from
  the game.  The named recipient (or the @toading wizard) get ownership of
  all the victim's things, rooms, and exits, as well as of the toad object
  itself.
 
  The following switches are available:
    /no_chown - Don't change the ownership of the victim or his objects.
  See also: @boot, @chownall, @destroy.

& @wall
  Command: @wall[/<switches>] <message>
  With no switches, shouts <message> to every connected player or to every
  connected wizard, prefixed by either 'Announcement:' (if for everyone) or
  'Broadcast:' (if for wizards).  The following switches can be used to get the
  described effects:
     /emit      - Format the message as an emit (ie send just <message>).
     /pose      - Format the message as a pose (ie <youname> <message>).
     /wizard    - Only send the message to connected wizards.
     /admin     - Send the message to connected wizards and royalty.
     /no_prefix - Don't prepend 'Announcement:' or 'Broadcast:' to the message.
  If neither /emit or /pose are used, you can format the message one of several
  ways by specifying ':', ';', or '"' as the first character of the message.
  ':' and ';' format the message as if /pose were specified, except that ';'
  does not insert a space between your name and the message.  '"' formats the
  message in normal @wall format (this is the default).
  The message is also written to the log file.

& INHERIT
  Flag: INHERIT(I) (all types)
  When set on an object, gives the object access to the WIZARD and IMMORTAL
  powers that its owner has, and also allows that object to control the player
  and other INHERIT objects owned by that player.
  When set on a player, gives all of that player's objects access to the
  WIZARD and IMMORTAL powers of their owner, and allows them to control the
  player or any object owned by the player.

& MARKED
  Flag: MARKED(m) (all types)
  This flag is used by the database cleaning routines to check the
  connectivity of the database, and also by the @mark commands to select
  objects for special attention.  Since database cleaning is performed
  automatically from time to time, automatic cleaning must be disabled
  before using the @mark commands, and the command @mark_all/clear should
  be run immediately before turning automatic cleaning back on.
  See also: @apply_marked, @dbck, @disable, @enable, @list, @mark,
            @mark_all.

& STARTUP
  Flag: STARTUP(z) (all types)
  This flag is managed internally by the server and it is not directly
  settable.  It indicates whether or not the object has a STARTUP attribute
  that is to be run when the MUX is booted.  This saves a considerable amount
  of time considering that very few objects have a STARTUP attribute.
  This flag is set automatically when the STARTUP attribute is set to a
  non-empty string, and cleared when the STARTUP attribute is removed or
  set to a null string.
  See also: @startup.

& SUSPECT
  Flag: SUSPECT(u) (players)
  When set on a player, causes connects, disconnects, name changes, kills,
  and attempted kills to be reported to all connected wizards.
  This flag is only visible and settable by wizards.

& WIZARD
  Flag: WIZARD(W) (all types)
  A player or object that is set WIZARD controls all of the objects in the
  database (except for player #1), regardless of their ownership or flags.
  In general, WIZARDs can do anything using #<number> or *<player>.
  Wizards can also use many additional commands that are useful for game
  administration and maintenance.
  Only player #1 can set or clear this flag.  An object owned by a Wizard has
  wizard privileges only if its WIZARD or INHERIT flag is set, or if the
  owning Wizard has his INHERIT flag set.
  See also: CONTROL, INHERIT.

& @allowance
  Attribute: Allowance
  Command: @allowance <object>[=<amount>]
  Sets the amount of money that the player receives each day he/she connects
  to the MUX.  The Allowance attribute overrides the default allowance
  specified by the paycheck config parameter.
  This attribute is only visible and settable by wizards.  It is only
  meaningful for players, and has no effect on other object types.

& @comment
  Attribute: Comment
  Command: @comment <object>[=<text>]
  Sets a wizard-visible comment on the indicated object.
  This attribute is only visible and settable by wizards.

& @timeout
  Attribute: Timeout
  Command: @timeout <object>[=<seconds>]
  Sets an idle timeout value on <object> that is different from the default
  value.  If the value is non-numeric or less than or equal to zero, then
  the default value is used.
  This attribute is only visible and settable by wizards.  It is only
  meaningful for players, and has no effect on other object types.
  See also: idle_timeout.

& MASTER ROOM
  The master room contains the default exits and $-commands for the MUX.
  The exits in the master room are checked if a command doesn't match an exit
  in the player's current room, and the $-commands on the room and its
  contents.
 
  Caution: Do not allow players into the master room, as they can leave
  objects that will be searched for $-commands.  Make sure that the room is
  not JUMP_OK or LINK_OK, and that any exits leading to the room are locked so
  that only wizards may use them.
 
  To make global commands, make an exit in the master room that is locked to
  #0 (or some other impossible lock) and has an appropriate Afail action (and
  possibly Fail and Ofail messages).  You can make global exits by having an
  unlocked exit from the master room (or an exit locked to a desired key
  object) lead to the desired destination.  When a player goes through one of
  these exits, any KEY objects are returned home, as is done with @teleport.
 
  Do not put too many objects in the room, because each object is searched
  for $-command every time anyone (or anything) anywhere on the MUX enters
  an unrecognized command.
  See also: @link, @lock, @open, master_room.

& access
  Config parameter: access <command> <permlist>

  Modifies the permissions needed to execute the indicated command.
  Specifying a permission adds it to the list of permissions required; to
  remove a permission prefix it with a ! character.
  See also: PERMISSIONS, @list.

& alias
  Config parameter: alias <new> <old>.

  Defines the command <new> to be an alias of the command <old>.

& allow_guest_from_registered_site
  Config parameter: allow_guest_from_registered_site. Default: yes.

  With this option turned off, guests are not permitted to connect from
  sites which have been register_site'd.

  Game which use register_site as a more surgical version of forbid_site
  may be interested in turn this option off. However, game which are
  register_only will probably want to leave this option as defaulted.

  See also: register_site, SITE LISTS

  Config parameter: config_access <param> [!]<privilege> [[!]<privilege>]...

  Changes the privileges needed to change the specified configuration
  parameter.  The value 'disabled' indicates that the parameter may only
  be specified in the configuration file at startup.  Setting privileges
  to anything other than disabled or god is meaningless unless the 
  restriction on the @admin command is weakened.

  See also: @admin, @list config_permissions, PERMISSIONS.

  If this parameter is set to yes, then players (and objects) may not
  teleport out of locations that they do not control or which are not set
  JUMP_OK.  If the teleporting player is inside an object, the room that
  ultimately contains the object is checked.  Going home is unaffected.

& find_money_chance
  Config parameter: find_money_chance <amount>.  Default: 0
  Indicates the chance that players have of finding money when entering a
  new room.  The chance is 1 / find_money_chance, except that finding money

  staff           - Only Staff, Royalty, Wizards, and God can set this flag.
  wizard          - Only Wizards and God can set this flag.
 
  There are some flags whose access permissions cannot be changed,
  since they are handled in a special way. This includes the DARK,
  and AUDIBLE flags.
 
& forbid_site
  Config parameter: forbid_site <addr> <mask>.
  Indicates that connections are to be rejected from sites whose address
  matches the specified address when ANDed with the mask.  The contents of
  the file specified by badsite_file is sent immediately before closing
  the connection.  This directive may be used to restrict access to just the
  local network, or to prevent access from troublemaking sites.

  See also: down_motd_file, max_players.

& function_invocation_limit
  Config directive: function_invocation_limit <num>.  Default: 2500
 
  This directive sets the maximum number of times that a command may make
  function calls.  If the invocation limit is exceeded, the string 
  '#-1 FUNCTION INVOCATION LIMIT EXCEEDED' is returned.  This limit is

  Note: @search is treated specially, each object examined with the
  eval=<arg> parameter is treated as a separate command for the purposes
  of the function invocation limit.

& function_recursion_limit
  Config directive: function_recursion_limit <num>.  Default: 50
 
  This directive sets the maximum number of nested function calls that
  may be made before the function call is aborted and the string

  This directive is only valid during startup.

& initial_size
  Config parameter: initial_size <number>.  Default: 1000

& kill_max_cost
  Config parameter: kill_max_cost <amount>.  Default: 100
  Specifies the maximum amount of money that may be usefully spent on a kill
  attempt.  Spending more than this amount does not improve the chance of
  success.  Setting this parameter to less than the kill_guarantee_cost
  parameter prevents 'automatic kills', as the kill will always have a chance
  of failing.

  See also: command_quota_incr, command_quota_max.

& TOAD_RECIPIENT
TOAD_RECIPIENT

  CONFIG PARAMETER: toad_recipient <player dbref>

  This is a configuration parameter; as such dbrefs should be given as the raw
  number and not be preceded by the usual '#' (this is interpreted the
  beginning of a comment by the config file parser).

  Default: #-1 (-1)

  When a player is @toaded (or @nuked) his or her property is normally @chowned
  to another player; toad_recipient controls who the recipient of the player's
  objects are. If the value is set to -1 the @toading wizard will get ownership
  of all the victim's objects, otherwise the specified player gets ownership.
  This can be explicitly overridden by providing a recipient with the @toad
  command.

  @toad/@nuke are potential security risks as they normally change the
  ownership of a victim (a non-privileged character and presumably untrusted
  player) to a player with wizard permissions. Furthermore, this can cause
  clutter and it can be often difficult to sort out unwanted objects after an
  @toading.

  It is recommended that games create a non-privileged character for the
  express purpose of being a toad_recipient.

  Example:
   > @pcreate Nobody=noone
   New player 'Nobody' created with password 'noone'
             (dbref of #57)

   > @admin toad_recipient=57

  when using top-down format.  Bottom-up format output is not affected by this
  parameter.
  Note that this parameter is intended as a limit on the amount of memory used
  to store intermediate data and not on the quantity of trace output, top-down
  format needs to keep all intermediate results in memory before displaying
  them, while bottom-up format displays them immediately after generating them.
  When trace output lines are discarded, only the last (trace_output_limit)
  lines are kept.  These lines contain information about the evaluations done
  earliest in the process of evaluating the expression (usually the innermost
  evaluations and earlier arguments of outer functions).

& trace_topdown
  Config parameter: trace_topdown <yes/no>.  Default: yes
  Specifies whether TRACE output is displayed top-down (complete evaluation
  shown first, followed by sub-evaluations), or bottom-up (sub-evaluations
  shown first, followed by the larger evaluation of which they are a part).

& INHERITANCE
& LOGGING
& PERMISSIONS
  Topic: PERMISSIONS
 
  Access to many MUX features is controlled by a set of permissions, which
  can usually be changed via the configuration file or the @admin command.
  
  In the following, 'WIZARD' means the WIZARD flag, but 'Wizard' means
  Wizard-level authority. The latter can be achieved by being set WIZARD, or
  set INHERIT with an owner that is set WIZARD, and of course #1 is always set
  WIZARD.

  This is a list of the valid permissions and their meanings:

    builder       - Must be Wizard, ROYALTY, or have the BUILDER power.
    dark          - Feature is not shown but is still available.
    disabled      - No one can use this feature.
    global_build  - Requires the BUILDER power, Wizard/ROYALTY, or for
                    building to be allowed game-wide.
    global_interp - Requires that global interpretation be turned on.
    god           - Only #1 may use this feature.
    head          - Must be set HEAD to use this feature.
    immortal      - Must be set IMMORTAL or set INHERIT with IMMORTAL owner.

& SEARCH CRITERIA
  Topic: SEARCH CRITERIA
 
  The following criteria may be used when searching the database with the
  @search and @mark commands:
 
  Syntax: {@mark|@search} [<player>] [<class>=<restriction>]
 
  <player>  - Restricts to objects owned by the named player.
              By default, the search is limited to objects owned by the
              invoking player, except when searching for players or if
              the invoking player is a wizard.
{ 'wizhelp search criteria2' for more }
& search criteria2
  The following classes may be used when searching:
 
  TYPE      - Restricts to objects of the indicated type (OBJECTS, ROOMS,
              EXITS, PLAYERS).
  NAME      - Restricts to objects whose names start with <restriction>.
  OBJECTS   - A combination of TYPE=OBJECT and NAME=<restriction>
  ROOMS     - A combination of TYPE=ROOM and NAME=<restriction>
  EXITS     - A combination of TYPE=EXIT and NAME=<restriction>
  PLAYERS   - A combination of TYPE=PLAYER and NAME=<restriction>
  FLAGS     - Restricts to objects which have the flags listed in
              <restriction> set.

  See: SITE LISTS
 
& SITE LISTS
  Topic: SITE LISTS
 
  There are two site lists, one for controlling access and registration, and
  one for suspect warning.  The first list is controlled by the forbid_site,
  permit_site, and register_site parameters, the second by the suspect_site
  and trust_site parameters. The syntax of these parameters is:
  <param-name> <address> <mask>, where:
 
  Address  - Four-part decimal Internet address, specified as a.b.c.d,
             of the host or network to which this parameter applies.
  Mask     - Four-part decimal Internet address, specified as a.b.c.d
             The mask is used to determine which parts of the address are
             to be used for comparison, it is ANDed with both the address
             of the host and the address in the directive.
 
  The parameters are applied in the order specified in the configuration file,
  and the first one that matches is used.  Therefore, you should put
  the more-specific parameters before the more general ones.
  Additions made to the lists after startup with the @admin command are put
  at the front of the list, and are checked before entries from the config
  file and previous entries made by the @admin command.

  Example:  Restricting Access
 
  register_site  135.246.4.40 255.255.255.255  <- Allow this site w/reg
  forbid_site    135.246.4.0  255.255.255.0    <- Disallow a class C subnet
  permit_site    135.246.0.0  255.255.0.0      <- Permit a class B network
  register_site  195.3.17.1   255.255.255.255  <- Permit this site w/reg.
  forbid_site    0.0.0.0      0.0.0.0          <- DIsallow everyone else
 
  These directives only allow access from 135.346.*.* and 195.3.17.1, except
  that all hosts in the 135.246.4 subnet except for 135.246.4.40 are also
  not allowed access.  People connecting from 135.246.4.40 and 195.3.17.1
  are not allowed to create their own characters (registration is enabled
  for those sites), while people connecting from elsewhere on the 135.246
  net are allowed to create their own characters.
